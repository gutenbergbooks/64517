<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume really needs little by way of introduction.
No one can mistake the evident love for our
feathered friends, the kindly assistance that has been
given them, and the success of the authors in imparting
to others much of that pleasure which they have undoubtedly
derived from their studies.</p>

<p>The same recreation lies within the power of all who
through inattention and thoughtlessness neglect the
almost priceless relief from daily burdens afforded by
such pursuits. Every one can learn something of the
ways and doings of our little friends, even though he
may never write a book or put a pen to paper concerning
them.</p>

<p>Knowledge thus acquired is not wasted; it elevates the mind and
trains the senses, so that in after life the habits of observing and
noting frequently become of great use, and are never a detriment.</p>

<p>Our authors have set forth the wanton destruction of
bird life consequent upon the use of feathers and parts
of birds to ornament hats. They have in no way misstated;
for tens of thousands of birds are annually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[ iv ]</a></span>
offered on the altar of fashion to gratify a cruel and
barbarous survival of savage adornment. Yet the male
friend of the lady who wears upon her head a gorgeous
array of mutilated, misshapen, and dyed birdskins may
have done something to assist in a similar destruction
of bird life. As a boy perhaps he wantonly deprived
some bird of her eggs; and later, when possessed of a
gun, he may have shown little discretion or thought
when depriving the nestling of a mother or father who
alone could feed and protect it. And as a man, too
often it may be, he has allowed savage instincts to dominate
his acts instead of the knowledge derived from
experience and thought.</p>

<p>It lies within the power of many who will read these
pages to assist in the distribution of evidence and in
the enlightenment of others, to the end that the useless
slaughter of birds and the destruction of their eggs
may be prevented, or at least greatly mitigated.</p>

<p>Within a few years past efforts have been made to
have one day a year in the schools set aside to study and
consider the ways and interests of our feathered friends.
The matter is of national importance, and deserves the
interest that has been taken in it; but without the
hearty cooperation of teachers and their efforts to interest
and instruct their charges, there is little likelihood
of accomplishing the end desired.</p>

<p>Each farmer or occupier of a tract of land has it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[ v ]</a></span>
within his power to set aside some portion of otherwise
non-usable land to afford shelter and concealment for
many birds, and to protect those useful species that
select and require special locations in which to rear
their young. The presence of birds in a locality lends
a charm to the landscape which nothing else can lend.
An abundance of useful and attractive species may be
encouraged to remain and breed if heed is paid to their
requirements, and efforts to disturb them in their orderly
pursuits be prevented. With slight care such
species as are not a detriment or nuisance can be assisted,
and thus the value of birds as a feature of the
landscape, as insect destroyers, and as vocalists can be
more and more demonstrated and appreciated.</p>

<p>There is a book, large and bulky, yet within the
reach of every one; little work is required to handle
it, for its pages are always open, and it is written in
the universal language. It costs nothing to read many
chapters, yet, as in all good things, a little patience
and some experience will assist greatly in acquiring a
fair understanding of its contents. In this great Book
of Nature will be found much concerning that rich and
varied division of animal life to which has been given
the name of Birds, and its relation to the welfare and
enjoyment of humanity.</p>

<p>Certain helps have been invented by the experiences
and intelligence of man to assist those who through inattention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[ vi ]</a></span>
unfavorable environment, or otherwise, have
been unable to acquire that knowledge of this book
essential to a correct understanding of their relation
to animated nature.</p>

<p>Such a help is this little volume, which it is hoped
may prove useful and instructive to many whose knowledge
of bird life is small, and also be well worth a reading
by those whose more extended opportunities have
permitted a wider knowledge of ornithology.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">THE MESSAGE OF A MOCKING-BIRD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the year 1877, before any of the children
who read this book were born. We were living on
one of the great reservations in the Indian Territory.
Some one knocked at the door. When the door was
opened, there stood a little Indian girl, her head all
covered up in a bright shawl. She was shy, as Indian
girls were before they had seen many white people.
Very timidly she drew her hand from under her shawl
and gave to us a baby mocking-bird. Then she turned
and ran down the prairie toward her buffalo-skin lodge
not far away.</p>

<p>We understood. The little girl's name was Kitty-ka-tat.
She had been to our house often. She knew
that we liked pets of all kinds, and birds most of all, so
she had captured this one for us by a kind of snare or
trap. Of course we kept it, for we did not know where
its nest was. We allowed it to use the whole house
for a cage. It ate wherever we ate, and slept at night
on the curtain pole above the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[ 2 ]</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_1" class="fig_center" style="width: 459px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Mocking-bird.</span></div>
</div>

<p>But the perch it liked best by day was the top of its
master's head. As soon as this gentleman came in and
sat down in the rocking-chair and put on his skullcap,
the bird would fly to his shoulder. Sometimes it would
take a nip at his ear or his hair. Then it would give
a hop and a flutter, and land in the middle of the black
skullcap, where it would sit for an hour if no one disturbed
it. It liked to take crumbs from our hands, or
bits of apple from our lips, standing on our shoulders.
It bathed every day in a large pan of water placed in
the middle of the carpet. Then, too wet to fly farther,
it would flutter all dripping to a low stool, where it
would dry its clothes after the wash. If a door
chanced to be left open, the bird would fly to the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[ 3 ]</a></span>
of it and preen its feathers and look about at us below
in a very pretty way. So you see the little thing really
washed and dried and ironed its clothes.</p>

<p>One day when it was perched on the top of the hall
door, as happy as could be, a gust of wind quickly blew
the door shut, with a loud noise. The bird gave a sharp
scream and flew to the window. We looked and saw a
strange sight,&mdash;a mocking-bird without a tail.</p>

<p>The little bundle of feathers had been shut in at the
top of the door when the wind closed it; and there sat
poor birdie, a mere chunk of a darling, turning its head
from side to side and looking sadly back at the place
where its tail had once been.</p>

<p>We opened the door, and down fluttered every one of
the beautiful feathers. Birdie eyed them with a puzzled
look, canting its head, as though it were saying,
"I don't understand it at all." Then it looked backward
again in a very pitiful way. We couldn't help
laughing, though we were so sorry for the bird. In a
short time the feathers grew again, and the little fellow
showed great care in preening them and placing them
just as it thought they ought to grow.</p>

<p>After a while there came to be a little baby in the
house, and the mocking-bird seemed to understand.
Two grown-up people had been its only friends before,
but it was never afraid of the stranger baby from the
first time it saw him. It would fly from any perch to
where the baby lay and peep into the baby's face in
the sweetest way, as if saying, "Glad to see you, little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4 ]</a></span>
man." Then it would twitter a low song, which
sounded very much as if it were singing, "Little one,
when you grow up, be kind to the birds and love
them."</p>

<p>"Be kind to the birds and love them" was the little
mocking-bird's message, or so it seemed to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The baby and his mother never forgot the message of
the mocking-bird. They have loved birds ever since.
That is why they are writing this book about birds for
the children.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">SOME PEOPLE WE LIKE TO KNOW.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are always interested in our nearest neighbors.
"Who lives in the next house?" we ask. "Are they
pleasant persons to know?" and "How many children
are there?"</p>

<p>These are questions one commonly asks. But we
are not speaking just now of men and women and children
who live near us on our street. We are speaking
of people all about us in our yard, and in your yard
perhaps,&mdash;little, winged, beautiful people, who make it
so pleasant with song and chirp and flutter,&mdash;the birds.</p>

<p>We like to think of the birds as creatures better and
more lovable than lizards and worms and other crawling
things. We know a lady who calls them "Angels,"
because they have wings and seem to fly far off into
heaven. No one ever jumps away from a bird, as some
foolish people do from a snake or a mouse. Most
snakes and mice are as harmless as birds, but they do
not win their way to our hearts as the birds do.</p>

<p>The yard or field that has the most trees and shrubs
in it will also have the most and the merriest birds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
Very few birds choose to live on a desert. They like
shade and grass and flowers as well as we do, and fruit
trees and berry bushes, and the sound of life and fun.</p>

<p>When we see a big tree chopped down, we think of
the birds who will miss it. Watch them yourselves.
See how they light on the fallen boughs, and peep sadly
under the wilting leaves, and twitter about their loss.
Birds are like ourselves; they like to live in the places
that are familiar to them, because here they feel at
home and safe. We sometimes think we can hear
them singing, "My country, 'tis of thee,&mdash;of thee I
sing."</p>

<p>Their "country" is our yard, and your yard, or the
woods or the city streets and house roofs, and they love
it. We should respect their rights and let them have
their little "America" in peace. We can apply the
Golden Rule as well to our treatment of the birds as to
one another.</p>

<p>There are enemies which are very troublesome to the
birds. Two or three hawks, some owls, and a few
boys, delight in scaring or killing them. We have
never seen a little girl harm a bird, and we know many
boys, as well, who would not hurt a bird "on purpose."
Their worst enemies are the cats.</p>

<p>These enemies do not come sailing over into the
birds' country in ships, or marching up the coast in
troops, carrying guns and beating drams and making
a great noise. They are cowardly, sneaking enemies.
They jump one at a time over hedges and fences, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7 ]</a></span>
they crawl under bushes barefoot, and dart across the
street when no one is looking. They are so still, gliding
on their soft feet, that no one of the bird family
can hear them coming. So whole nestfuls of baby birds
are gone before their mothers know it.</p>

<p>Cats have learned that they are not welcome in our
yard. If one of them slips in before we are up in the
morning, the birds tell us by a sort of "shriek," and
we hurry to help them. We have seen six or seven
different kinds of birds crying at a cat and flying at
him at one time. They even nip at his back, and dart
up so quickly that the cat has no chance to spring at
them.</p>

<p>The orioles and mocking-birds are our best watch-dogs,
screaming with very angry voices at sight of a
cat, and warning all the other birds in the yard to
"look out." In the orchard there were some stray cats
that nobody owned, and we thought it right to shoot
the hungry, thieving things. One mocking-bird, who
had been robbed once by these cats, would point out a
cat to us, flying on ahead, and would not jump away at
the sharp bang of the gun. She seemed to understand
perfectly well that we were protecting her and aiming
at the enemy she feared so much.</p>

<p>We have read how wild beasts from the jungle prowl
around the homes of India to snatch the children and
carry them off. How careful the mothers must be,
always watching for the cruel animals and dreading
their quick spring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother birds in our yard are like those human
mothers in India. You have only to watch them when
a cat comes prowling around to see how very much like
human mothers they are. They scream and dart about
in fright, and if you go near they will fly not from you,
but toward the cat. They are asking you for help.</p>

<p>Birds near your house soon learn to know the family
if every one is kind to them, when they have once
learned that you are their friend. They will allow you
to call while they are eating their meals, or to watch
them while nest-building, although they may be almost
within reach of your hand. They will even wait around
the door for you to shake the tablecloth after dinner, or
to throw out the contents of the crumb-pan, hopping
about at your feet without a thought of fear.</p>

<p>We never can learn all there is to know about birds.
We can know only a little about them if we study them
all our lives.</p>

<p>There is a great professor in a California university
who has been trying all his life to get acquainted with
fishes, and yet he says he has much more to learn about
them. Very little people, like birds and fishes and
insects, can interest very great men, and we often see
the greatest men the kindest to small creatures.</p>

<p>We speak of birds in this book as "people," because
they seem very near to us. They are beings who think
and plan and love, and who know what it is to be sorry
or glad, just like ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">CIVILIZED BIRDS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> new parts of the country we do not find so many
birds living near houses as we find in older towns.
Where there is much wooded or uncultivated land for
them to live and nest in, the birds prefer to stay at
some distance from us. But after the fields are all
ploughed, and the trees cut down, they become civilized
and learn to love our gardens and barns and houses.</p>

<p>We speak of birds as "wild" or "civilized," just as
we speak of the races of men. The birds in our yard
are civilized. They will eat cooked food if we give
it to them. They will bathe in a tub, if it is handy,
as if it were a brook in the woods. They will nest in
cosey nooks about the home in the vines and under the
barn eaves, or in little houses which we build for them
and set up on poles or in the arbors. They will follow
the furrow which the plough makes, looking for worms,
and will help themselves to our fruit without waiting
for an invitation.</p>

<p>Many of them soon learn to prefer the barn-yard to
the field, and will hop about with the chickens under
the horse's feet. The sparrows and towhees come every
day when the cow eats her pail of bran. They gather
about close to her head and watch for her to finish her
meal, very much as you have seen one dog watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span>
another dog at his bone. When the cow is done, the
birds take possession of her pail and pick out every
crumb she has left.</p>

<p>The blackbird<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is more civilized than most other
birds. You are all acquainted with him, for we find
him at home almost everywhere. Though he dresses
differently in different parts of the country, he is always
a blackbird. Where we live he has a white eye, like a
tricky horse. He likes the company of sheep and cattle
in our pastures and lanes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the west, Brewer's blackbird, <i>Scolecophagus cyanocephalus</i>;
in the east, purple grackle, <i>Quiscalus quiscula</i>.</p></div>

<p>We have seen these birds taking a free ride all over
the fields, while the good-natured animals seemed to
like it and did not try to shake them off. Once we
laughed merrily when we saw a whole flock of blackbirds
taking a ride "pig back," while the pigs rooted
away in the ground, paying no attention to the birds
on their backs.</p>

<p>Once when we were in Sitka, Alaska, a long way
from home, we went out very early to watch the birds.
We saw a great black raven on the back of a donkey
that had been lying down all night on a bed of straw.
The raven pecked the donkey's back and made him get
up from his warm bed. Then the hungry bird made a
breakfast of the insects that had crept under the donkey
during the cold night to share his warmth. We were
told that this raven was in the habit of getting his
breakfast in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In nesting time civilized birds are glad to get the
odds and ends of strings and cotton which we give
them. They chirp about it while they pull at the
twine, as if they were saying, "What a blessing it is
to live among civilized people, who give us strings and
other things to make our cradles of."</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Crow Blackbird.</span></div>
</div>

<p>They like to scratch in the hay and chaff for kernels
of grain. When you see the birds about the barn-doors,
or under the shed at the grain, watch them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span>
notice that they do not really scratch, as at first sight
they seem to do, but hop quickly on both feet with
their toes spread far apart. They hop so fast that you
can scarcely see their feet through the flying chaff.</p>

<p>It is hard to be quite certain whether a bird walks
or hops when it is after its food on the ground. Some
of them, like the sparrows and towhees, have a quick,
jerky pace that looks like a very fast run.</p>

<p>Some birds never run or hop on their feet. The fly-catchers
and humming-birds belong to this class. Yet
these birds are not cripples. Their tiny legs are fitted
only to hold them on the perch. If they wish to catch
an insect the length of their bill away, they will fly to
get it, just as if it were across the yard. Their wings
are so strong and move so quickly that these birds do
not need to walk or run. They sip their honey or
snatch flies and spiders while on the wing.</p>

<p>All birds are alike in many habits, just as people all
over the world have some ways in common. Yet there
are some birds who are very different from all others.
Indeed, there are so many things to know about them,
that it is difficult to know just where to begin.</p>

<p>What kind of clothes do birds wear? What do they
eat, and when is their meal-time, and how do they fly?
How do they make their nurseries or nests, and how do
they know just how large these ought to be? Do birds
talk and laugh and play at games? What sort of a
mother does a bird make, and what do the father birds
think of the babies? Do birds have a childhood after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[ 13 ]</a></span>
their babyhood, and are they allowed by their parents
to grow up idle and helpless? Will our wild birds
grow tame and trustful if we love and pet them, and
do they learn to prefer such food as we eat ourselves?
In short, does it pay to cultivate the acquaintance of
birds and to think of them as people?</p>

<p>We will talk about these things in this little book,
and when we are done, perhaps you will wonder that
you did not get up earlier and know more about the
beautiful little winged people in your yard.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">HOW BIRDS DRESS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> temperate climates like this birds do not dress in
such bright colors as they do in hot countries. Their
coats and gowns are plainer. There are few extremes
in color here, as there are few extremes in heat or cold.</p>

<p>We can tell almost any race or class of people by
their style of dress or lack of dress. We can name the
trees and shrubs and vines by their foliage, which is
really their dress; so we know the different kinds of
birds by their plumage or dress.</p>

<p>Many birds resemble in color the haunts or places
which they like the best. Desert birds are pale or
gray, like the sand. Many of those in the tropics are
dressed in gay colors, like the bright blossoms about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
them, while many birds in the cold north are white
like the snow. By this we see that in all nature, and
especially among the bird people, dress is of great
importance.</p>

<p>Some of the larger and coarser birds have been accused
of being very untidy about their dress. They do
not seem to care how they look, and do not show their
clothes off proudly as others do. But people who think
this have not observed them very closely. Birds like
the hawks and vultures are really very neat and tidy.</p>

<p>Turkey buzzards<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> look very ugly and rough at first
glance, but their plumage is suited to their needs,
and they take great pains to be clean.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Turkey vulture, <i>Cathartes aura</i>.</p></div>

<p>You will notice that the buzzard has no feathers on
his head and neck, and it is this lack of hat or bonnet
that makes this bird look so odd and unlovely. But
we must not be in a hurry to blame him for this, nor
call him hard names because he does not happen to
wear a collar or head-dress. There are some things
which we do not understand unless we first ask questions
or get better acquainted with people.</p>

<p>You see the buzzard, like the scavengers who clean
up our dirty streets, is always at work on dead things
and scraps of garbage which we do not want. We
respect him for doing a very necessary sort of work.
He must dress to suit his occupation, like other sensible
people, though we cannot help wishing the buzzard
had a suit of Sunday clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_4" class="fig_center" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/fig_4.png" width="438" height="347" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Turkey Buzzard.</span></div>
</div>

<p>He wears nothing on his head because he is obliged
to reach far in beneath bones and thick skin in search
of food. If he wore a head-dress, like his neighbors,
it would get very foul and ill-smelling, and we should
think him far more untidy than he is. As it is, he can
slip his naked head into marrow bones and out again
without much trouble, and not be afraid of spoiling his
hat, as other birds would.</p>

<p>We would not care to be daily companions of the
buzzard and the carrion crow, although they are useful
and interesting birds. We would prefer to be in the
company of better dressed and better bred people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the birds we know think a great deal about
their dress. They work much of their time to keep it
tidy and in good order. They mend their clothes, too,
although they do not use a needle and thread. A little
girl we know laughed heartily one day when we told
her that the robin mends her dress when it is torn.</p>

<p>The little girl had only to watch and see that Mrs.
and Miss Robin, and other birds as well, smooth out
and fix up the torn and rumpled feathers till they look
as good as new.</p>

<p>Different kinds of birds have different fashions, but
these fashions never change. A bird to-day dresses
exactly as its grandmother did, and the birds never
seem to make fan of one another for being old-fashioned.</p>


<p>Once in a long while we find a solitary bird different
in color from others of its kind. We have seen a white
blue jay, and there is in our yard a brown towhee which
has two white feathers in its wing. Such birds are
very rare, as are people who have a spot of white hair
on their heads when all the rest is dark; or albinos,
that is, persons with pink eyes and very white skin,
although they belong to a dark race.</p>

<p>Two suits of clothes a year are quite enough for most
birds, while one suit is all that others can afford. But
birds are very careful of their clothes, although they
never try to dress more gaily than their neighbors and
friends. They only try to be clean, and so they set us
a very good example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Sit down on the grass under a tree, or on a seat in
the park, and see the birds dress themselves. Every
separate feather is cleaned and pulled and looked over,
just as a woman cleans and stretches delicate lace and
embroidery. See how the loose feathers are pulled out
and dropped, like so many useless ravellings or worn
threads. The bird watches the falling plume until it
reaches the ground, canting her head to one side to see
what becomes of her tatters, and then she goes on with
her dressing.</p>

<p>Madam Bird manages very well to twist about and
reach all of her clothes except her head-dress. Have
you wondered how a bird can turn its head all around
in a way that would cramp your own neck if you should
try it? The neck of a bird is more flexible than yours;
that is, it is furnished with more joints, so that the bird
can turn its head readily and dress itself with ease.</p>

<p>A bird never changes the whole of its dress at once.
Little by little the feathers drop out or are pulled away,
so that they are not missed. If they should all come
out in one day or one week, the bird would be helpless
and unable to fly.</p>

<p>If you should attempt to smooth a bird's feathers
without knowing how, you would very likely make her
look very ragged. Naturalists, who know how because
they have practised so much, can smooth and pull the
feathers as well as the bird herself. They can pick
up a hurt bird and by a few touches make her look
respectable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">HOW MADAM BIRD COMBS HER HAIR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madam Bird</span> is not able to smooth her head-dress
with her bill. What does she do about it? Why, she
uses her foot, which serves also as her hand.</p>

<p>Birds are either-handed; that is, they can use the
left hand or foot as well as the right. Some people
think that a parrot is left-handed, because she always
takes in her left hand the cracker or sugar which you
offer to her. The next time you feed her, stop and see
what you are doing. You are standing in front of the
bird and offering her the cracker in your right hand.
She is facing you, and of course takes the food with
her left hand. Everybody gives her things in the same
way, and she naturally uses her left hand, because we
teach her to do so.</p>

<p>But wild birds are either handed. Watch and see
how they comb their hair, first on one side and then on
the other, scratching very fast, as if to get all the tangles
out, but never crying, "Oh, don't!" when it
pulls. We call the fine feathers "hair," because they
grow on the bird's head as our hair does on our
own.</p>

<p>See how Mrs. Bird lifts her crown and separates the
soft feathers, and fixes her frizzes or bangs, if she wears
them. After she has combed her hair this way long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19 ]</a></span>
enough, she smoothes it down in good order with her
hair dressing, as you will see later on.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice a bird wash its ears? That is
enough to make you smile, but we assure you it does
wash its ears and all around its mouth after its meals,
and between meals as often as it is necessary.</p>

<p>Watch your tame canary; he is very much like wild
birds in habits of neatness. See him stand on one foot
and reach the other foot up quickly between the long
feathers of his wing and dig away at his ears, just as if
his mother had told him to "get ready for school."</p>

<p>We have laughed many a time to see him wash himself,
he does it so deftly and cheerfully, as if it were
the greatest fun in the world. Then, to get the corners
of his mouth clean, he wipes them on his towel. His
towel is his perch or any cross-bar in the cage. You
may say he is "sharpening his bill," but he is really
wiping his face. He has probably washed it in his
bath a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Some birds wear their hair done up high on their
heads like a "pug,"&mdash;the "crest" as we call it, standing
out like the twist of the fashion. Others, such as our
mountain quail,<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> prefer something like a Chinaman's
queue or the revolutionary braids. Others still comb
their hair down plain and neat like little Quakers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In Southern California, <i>Oreortyx pictus plumiferus</i>.</p></div>

<p>But whichever way a bird dresses its head, it is
always becoming and pretty. We have watched birds
dressing themselves, sitting or standing on the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20 ]</a></span>
the tub under the hydrant, or at the brook or puddle,
and we have wondered if they were not looking at
themselves in the water, flirting and twisting and turning
about just like real people at a looking-glass.</p>

<p>Most birds wear short dresses or skirts in true walking
style, while a few prefer the trail. But one thing
we have noticed: they never allow the trail to drag in
the dust or mud, not even the road-runner, whose train
is sometimes twelve inches long.</p>

<div id="fig_5" class="fig_center" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/fig_5.png" width="428" height="263" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Mountain Quail.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A mocking-bird or a robin will let her train just
touch the ground when she stretches up to look about
her; but when she begins to walk again she lifts it.
So you never see the tip of the longest tail one bit
draggled, unless the bird is wounded or sick.</p>

<p>If you watch closely, you will learn to tell a male
bird from a female bird by its dress. To be sure, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21 ]</a></span>
coat skirts are cut so much like the dress of his mate
that we sometimes have to imagine a good deal to see
any difference.</p>

<p>But, as a rule, you can tell the male or gentleman
bird because he dresses so much more gayly than his
mate, although we do not think he spends quite so
much time as she in fixing and mending his clothes
and in bathing. The lady bird works harder than her
mate in going to market to get lumber and nails for
her house or cradle, and so she soils her clothes more.
Then she sits longer in the nest and works harder in
many ways, never once thinking about putting on an
apron.</p>

<p>You must not think too hard of the gentleman birds
for letting their mates do the most of the home work,
for you remember that it is the male who must always
be ready for his place in the orchestra at a moment's
notice. He is obliged to make most of the music, and
if he should neglect his duty he would probably lose
his place and be put out of the choir.</p>

<p>A singer bird has no notes spread out before him,
but must go over and over his part, until he knows it
by heart with no one to prompt him.</p>

<p>You need not be surprised because we said a bird
must get lumber and nails for her house or cradle. If
she did not have lumber and nails, she could not do her
work. Of course you never hear her pounding with
a hammer, still she uses what may be called nails, as
you shall see by and by.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">WHAT BIRDS CARRY IN THEIR POCKETS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> birds wear on their heads plumes, or bright and
showy hats. These they sometimes lift in true bird
style. There is the ruby-crowned kinglet<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which one
sees in the garden trees. When this little king lifts
his hat, he shows what looks like a ruby crown or jewel
on top of his head.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> <i>Regulus calendula.</i></p></div>

<p>Other birds wear cocked hats, or tall silk hats with
waving plumes. You can imagine almost anything
you like in the dress of a bird, from his hat to his
shoes. When a bird who wears a hat is surprised by
another bird, or is angry, or when he wants to "show
off" to his mate while paying his respects to her, he
lifts the feathers on the top of his head; and this is
what we call "lifting his hat."</p>

<p>Many of our merry little bird friends, both male and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23 ]</a></span>
female, wear bonnets or hoods, which we think are tied
closely under the chin. Others, like the woodpeckers,
wear collars of lace. This lace is made of loose, filmy
feathers, as different from the feathers of the breast or
back as embroidery is different from closely woven cloth.</p>

<div id="fig_6" class="fig_center" style="width: 473px;">
<img src="images/fig_6.png" width="473" height="338" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Ruby-crowned Kinglet.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When a warm day comes, you will see the birds lift
their wings and hold their feathers close, and pant
with their bills open. How tired they look, and the
song or twitter which you hear is a weary one, as if
they were saying, "The oldest inhabitant never saw so
warm a day." In a cold snap the dress fluffs out, and
the bird looks much larger than he did on the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24 ]</a></span>
day. It seems as if he were saying, "See me make my
wraps as big and thick as I can."</p>

<p>Many of the birds that sit up and fly about all the
long cold night are more warmly clothed than most day
birds, who tuck themselves into bed as soon as the sun
sets. Examine the owls and see how warmly they
dress. Many of them wear trousers of feathers, reaching
to the knees or coming low down to the ankles.
Often their feet are covered with feathers down to their
sharp claws. Their necks, too, are all wrapped up with
feathers, like comforters or woollen scarfs, so that only
the bill may be seen.</p>

<div id="fig_7" class="fig_center" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/fig_7.png" width="427" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Short-eared Owl.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It gets pretty cold in the middle of the night, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25 ]</a></span>
Mr. Owl knows how to wrap himself up. Besides,
with these thick, soft feathers he can fly after his prey
without making any noise.</p>

<p>A bird's shoes and stockings are strong and never
seem to wear out. If they become worn, they are
mended so quickly you never know the difference.
The foot and leg are covered with scales, like the
scales on a lizard.</p>

<p>Birds and lizards are much alike; in fact, they are
a sort of cousin or distant relative, so that they dress
alike in the matter of shoes and stockings. Only the
lizard wears scales all over, while a bird wears them
only for shoes and stockings. The bird has found out
that feathers are better for flying in the air, while the
lizard, crawling as he always does, is perfectly happy
with only scales for clothes.</p>

<p>All birds, big and little, wear warm, fleecy underclothes,
better and softer than flannel. You can see
bits of these underclothes at the bottoms of the knee
trousers or dresses, or, if you happen to be holding a
bird in your hand, you can part the outer clothes and
see and feel the delicate down. Sometimes, when a
bird ruffles his outer garments in washing himself, the
soft warm underclothes are in plain sight.</p>

<p>Birds never use complexion powders; that, no doubt,
would seem very vulgar to them. But they do use hair
oil every day. They carry this mixture about with
them in their pockets. By pockets we mean little
pouches or sacks which always lie on the back, near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26 ]</a></span>
tail. Birds would not be quite dressed without their
pockets, and they know where to find them without
any trouble. We suppose this is because birds' pockets
have always been in the same place.</p>

<p>If it looks like rain, the "hair oil," as we call it, is
used more freely. Suppose the lady bird wishes to oil
the back of her head and around her face. Of course
she is not able to take up the bottle and pour the oil into
her hand; but she squeezes a little out with her beak,
as you would press a rubber bulb. Then she lays the
oil on her back just above her wings.</p>

<p>To get the oil all about where she wishes to put it,
she rubs her head against it, twisting and turning her
neck, until all the feathers of her head are straight and
shining.</p>

<p>When a shower comes, the water falls or slides down
the bird's back and shoulders on the oil, never finding
its wet way beneath to the underclothing. Birds are
like those people who live in the cold and wet north.
The Eskimo are said to rub their whole bodies with
seal or fish oil to keep themselves from being wet.</p>

<p>Bird babies seldom have any clothing to begin life
with. A few, such as the walkers and waders and
most of the swimmers, like quail and sandpipers and
ducks, are covered with thick down when they come
out of their shell.</p>

<p>Many of the bird babies in our yard have hardly a
trace of the finest down, while others have a little of it
in patches, like tiny shirts or bibs. Birds which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27 ]</a></span>
no clothes are hatched in the warmest nests, and are
close to the mother's breast almost all the time, until
their clothes have time to grow. They do not have oil
in their pockets until they have feathers to put it on.</p>

<div id="fig_8" class="fig_center" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/fig_8.png" width="447" height="336" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A baby bird has such a wide mouth that he looks
very odd. But then, you see, his mouth is wide on
purpose, so that the parent birds can drop the food in
quickly. If the parents had to hunt around to find six
or eight little mouths, many a nice bug or worm would
get away and the babies go hungry.</p>

<p>Look into a nest and see that four or five open bills
are as much of the young birds as you can catch sight
of above the edge of the nest. Each is trying to open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28 ]</a></span>
his mouth a little wider than his brothers and sisters
so that it can get the first mouthful. We have often
wondered how the mother knows which bird to feed
when she comes to the nest. We spent two or three
days once to be quite sure that she fed all alike. She
fed them in turn, even though she returned many times,
not once giving the last one another bite until she had
been all around. We do not know whether she counts
them or calls them by name, but she makes no mistake
in feeding them.</p>

<p>We saw a humming-bird mother one day stand on
the head of one little baby birdling while she fed the
other. Not all of her weight was on the bird, of course,
but quite enough to make him keep out of her way
while she fed his brother.</p>

<p>A baby bird gains nothing by teasing and coaxing;
it must wait for its turn to come, no matter how hungry
it happens to be. It is probably more greedy than
hungry when it wants to get more than its share.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">CHILD BIRDS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> childhood, that is, during the first season,
most birds look quite different from their parents.
Many of them do not get the color or texture of
grown-up birds for a year or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29 ]</a></span></p>

<p>You can soon learn to tell which are the children
among the birds by what they wear and by the way they
talk. Their voices are childish and coaxing. They
sometimes cry, and call in piping tones even after they
have learned to fly to the highest tree, or to soar far
into the blue sky, just to see how high they can go.</p>

<p>We have sometimes thought that bird children play
at games of hide-and-seek among the bushes, and that
they try to see which one of them can jump the farthest.
Watch them for yourselves, and you will see such fun
as will make you laugh.</p>

<p>Birds are like other children, they get hungry very
often at their play. We have seen whole broods of
young orioles following the old birds about and teasing
for food long after the next nest of birdlings was
hatched. These teasing children were as large as their
parents, and might better have been feeding their
younger brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Parent birds often drive their young away from them,
and eat the food which they have caught themselves
right before the children, as if to say, "Go, find some
for yourselves."</p>

<p>In Southern California, where we live, in midsummer
the yard seems full of young linnets<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> coaxing from day-light
till dark. All the limbs of the trees are alive
with them. They stand in rows, with their mouths
wide open, and we wonder how the old birds can take
care of so many children at once. We see the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30 ]</a></span>
birds teasing one another sometimes, as if they were
saying, "Tommy dear," or, "Susy dear, please divide
your lunch."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div id="fig_9" class="fig_center" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/fig_9.png" width="449" height="453" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Linnet.</span></div>
</div>

<p>So we see that birds have a childhood as well as a
babyhood, but it is very short, for they are soon taught
to work hard and to be self-supporting.</p>

<p>A lazy young bird never gets on in the world.
Parent birds are very kind but firm. It sounds as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31 ]</a></span>
they were sometimes scolding good-naturedly. We
imagine them saying to their children, "We have
shown you the seeds and the berries, now go to work.
If you want food, help yourselves; for we have been to
market for you long enough. Dress yourselves, too.
See how you each have a bottle of oil. Now be neat
and careful of your clothes, for it will be a long while
before you get any more."</p>

<p>We have seen young birds make very awkward
attempts at dressing themselves. Sitting in a tree,
they try to imitate the old birds, fluttering and turning
about, and rubbing their small heads on their shoulders,
and falling off from the branch in their excitement.</p>

<p>It is this daily care of their clothes that makes birds
so beautiful. It seems to us that they know very well
that they will not be able to get a new suit very often,
and that they must take good care of those clothes they
have. We have never seen child birds smear their food
over their faces and clothes, not even when they were
eating bread and butter and stewed blackberries. It
may seem funny to you that birds should eat bread and
butter and stewed blackberries, as if they were cooks
and housekeepers. But they really do, as you shall
see by and by.</p>

<p>Little birds pay attention to what is said to them.
They learn their lessons well, and they "say their
pieces" like any child, and, like children, they seem
to make mistakes at first. They do not take their
dinner-pails and go long distances to school. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32 ]</a></span>
learn at home with their fathers and mothers and
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The school-house is anywhere, in the yard or the
woods or fields. If you take the trouble to listen
and keep very quiet in midsummer, you will be able to
see and hear these bird schools going on at a rate that
will make you smile and think that birds are real people.</p>

<p>You can see the children in the nests or on the
branches of trees, or even on the ground, learning
musical notes, and the letters of their alphabet, and
running the bird scale, just like any class in school.
Every now and then you will see them skip out for a
drink of water at the pump or brook. They may not
hurry back at once, but stop to look at themselves in
the water and to frolic about in the ferns and grass.</p>

<p>Birds have a very happy childhood. It will pay any
child or grown person to spend a whole summer or
autumn in studying them and their ways. This would
be much better than wishing one could go somewhere,
when one hasn't the money to go with, or being unhappy
because one hasn't fine clothes and houses.</p>

<p>Young birds do not seem to be very much afraid of
us. They only look a little surprised and try to hop a
bit faster if we go too near them.</p>

<p>See how queer the tops of their heads look, with the
baby down still sticking out in little tufts through the
thicker feathers. Their lips, too, along the edges of
the bill!&mdash;how yellow they are, as though they had just
been eating new spring butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Those soft yellow lips will soon turn dark and hard
from use, just as a real baby's feet lose their pink softness
and grow callous when the child goes barefoot a
while.</p>

<p>Altogether, bird children are very interesting, and
one who loves them never gets tired of watching them.
There is something new and charming to learn every
day. We wonder that there are any unhappy or cross
or sulky people in the world, when they may have the
birds to teach them better.</p>

<p>There is many a kind little boy who picks up a child
bird and puts it in a high place out of reach of cats
and naughty boys. These may be sure that the mother
bird will find her young one, and you may hear her
thanking you, if you listen. Besides, every time a
boy is good to a child bird he has made his own childhood
richer and happier.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">HOW BABY BIRDS ARE FED.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the baby birds are nurslings, like the lambs
and colts. They are dependent upon what the parent
birds first eat and digest. Others eat just what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34 ]</a></span>
old birds do from the start. Only you will notice that
the mother bird pounds and bruises the food she gives
to her young, tapping it on the edge of the nest or on
a twig or the ground until it is soft enough for the
birds to swallow without danger of scratching their
tender throats.</p>

<p>Linnets, pigeons, humming-birds, and some of the
finches, are nurslings. The food is prepared for them by
the parent birds, and the young are fed by the old bird's
bill. We imagine that the bill of the parent bird is
the nursing-bottle. The old birds first eat food themselves,
and then work it over in their crops into a sort
of paste or milky fluid. Then, when the meal is all
ready, they alight on the edge of the nest and feed the
babies. We have seen humming-bird mothers feed the
babies while poised on their wings above the nest.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are four or five finches all clamoring
for breakfast, crying, and stretching their little necks
up as high as possible. The old bird on the edge of
the nest looks at the open mouths of all her babies, and
begins at the one she thinks is the hungriest. She
puts the nursing-bottle, which is her bill, far down the
throat of the nursling, clinging fast to the nest or twig
with her toes, and moving her bill up and down, her
own throat throbbing all the while.</p>

<p>We once saw a humming-bird feed one of her young
ones and then fly away. During her absence the little
birds changed places in the nest, turning completely
around. When the mother came back to finish giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35 ]</a></span>
them their breakfast, she made no mistake, but fed the
hungry one, though both had their bills wide open.</p>

<p>When the mother has fed one child as much as she
thinks is its share, she turns to the next open mouth.
In this way she nurses the whole cradleful, who seem
never to be satisfied.</p>

<div id="fig_10" class="fig_center" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/fig_10.png" width="426" height="298" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Humming-Bird feeding her Young.</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen no "runts" or dwarf birds in a family,
as are sometimes seen in a nest of pigs or puppies.
The parent birds seem to understand, and to see that
each baby has its proper share and not a crumb more.
They do not love one better than another.</p>

<p>Some birds keep on nursing their young long after
we think the lazy children are large enough to be
looking out for themselves. It would be no better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36 ]</a></span>
than they deserve if they had to go hungry sometimes.
We think they often must get very hungry before they
have learned to work for their board. This is all right,
for if the parents kept on supporting them, what useless
creatures they would be!</p>

<p>We shall tell you after a while about our bird's
restaurant. We have seen the young birds follow
their mother to the table at this restaurant and stand
coaxing for the crumbs. At first the mocking-bird
mother picks up the food and puts it in the young
bird's mouth, and then she flies away. She has given
it only a little, just to show the little bird where the
food is and how to pick it up himself. There he will
stand, looking at the cookie crumbs and teasing as loud
as he can, but the mother will not come back. She sits
in a tree near by watching to see how her bird child
learns his first lesson at helping himself.</p>

<p>After a while, the young bird gets very hungry and
begins pecking for the crumbs. At first he makes very
awkward attempts at grabbing a crumb, but he succeeds
at last and swallows the rest of his breakfast.
We laugh, sitting in the shade watching him, and we
think his mother is laughing too, in the tree above.</p>

<p>Those birds that do not nurse their young with
liquid food are supposed to give them water as well as
food, by bringing it to them in their beaks, though we
have not seen them do so. Probably the babies are fed
on soft worms and fruits until they have cut their first
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37 ]</a></span></p>

<p>How can the little things eat hard seeds and bones
before they have any teeth? Does it make you smile
and wonder when we speak of baby birds cutting their
teeth? Don't you suppose birds have teeth? Of course
they have.</p>

<p>Every bird has a set of false teeth working out of
sight. Birds never have the toothache, and they do
not have to be brave and hold still while somebody
pulls their teeth out. They can have a new set of teeth
as often as they need them, without paying a good
price to the dentist.</p>

<p>Look along the path and you will see these teeth,
lying as thick as hail in some places. Little sharp
stones, coarse gravel, and fine sand,&mdash;these are the
bird's teeth. When a bird picks them up, he swallows
them, and they go, without any trouble, right where
they belong, down to a kind of pouch or pocket called
the gizzard. This pocket is lined with very tough
muscles. These muscles or rings look something like
a fluting-iron or washboard, and as they move they set
the teeth or little stones to rolling against the food in
such a way that it is soon ground into bits, or rather
into paste.</p>

<p>It takes a baby bird a long time to learn to pick up
anything with its bill. It will peck and peck at the
food without being able to touch it, as we have seen
many birds do when brought up in a cage, and as the
little mocking-birds do at the garden table.</p>

<p>Once we had some pet orioles, and before we noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38 ]</a></span>
what he was doing, one of them made his bill look like
a hawk's bill, all curved or crooked. He had pecked
so hard at the food on the board floor of his cage that
the hard taps had bent his soft bill out of shape, and it
remained so after the bird had grown up. We have
seen a blue jay and a thrush and a towhee, each with
his beak out of shape, twisted to one side or broken.
This must have been done when they were little.
Birds, like other people, must have the right start if
they are to be beautiful when they are older.</p>

</div>


<p>Though young birds can see the food before them,
they have to try a long while before they know exactly
how to take hold of it. They make us think of real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39 ]</a></span>
babies trying to pick up some toy with their fat little
hands. A bird's bill at first is very soft, like a baby's
bones. If you feel of it, you will see that to the touch
it is like a piece of rubber.</p>

<p>The difficulty is really more with the bird's eyes than
with his bill, for it seems that, although he sees the
food which he wants to eat, he cannot measure the distance
correctly until he has learned how to see straight
and aim right.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">AT MEAL-TIME.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we had twenty birds in a cage and had to hunt
for all the food they could eat, the same as they would
do if they were free, we should have a busy time of it,
and very likely the birds would starve.</p>

<p>Birds have sharp eyes. Watch the finches and see
how they hop from twig to twig, pecking at tiny things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40 ]</a></span>
which we cannot even see. These birds seem to be
near-sighted, finding their dinner right under their eyes.
We could not possibly see anything so near our faces.</p>

<p>Then there are some of the birds who seem far-sighted,
seeing food at a longer distance than we could,
and darting for it as quick as a flash.</p>

<p>It is a fact that most birds are both near-sighted and
far-sighted. Their eyes are both telescopes and microscopes.
Watch Madam Mocker or Mrs. Robin. She
will see a grasshopper on the other side of the lawn, or
a daddy-long-legs taking a sun-bath at the far end of
the picket fence. The grasshopper and the daddy
haven't time to get up and be off before they are surprised
by Madam Bird's sharp bill.</p>

<p>Birds, like other people, must work if they will eat,
and so they go in search of the cupboard or the cellar,
and it is sometimes hard work to find them. The cupboard
is anywhere in a dry place, and the door is never
locked. The cellar is almost anywhere, too, where it
is cool and damp, under the grass and chips and down
in cracks between logs and boards. The food in the
cellar is very unlike the food in the cupboard.</p>

<p>There are some insects that never see the light and
cannot bear the sunshine. They are usually soft, tender
things, and live where it is moist and cool. We call
these the food in the bird's cellar. There are other
insects that love the dry air, where it is warm, the
bark of trees and the hot sand, and these we call the
food in the bird's cupboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[ 41 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Birds spend nearly all their time in hunting for
something to eat. Life seems to be one long picnic
for them. They digest rapidly. Their food is found
and picked up in very small quantities, excepting the
food of the gourmands like the buzzards. These birds
are certainly not very tidy or nice about their meals.
They eat as much as they possibly can, and then sit
about on the low fences, or even on the ground, too
full and heavy to fly away.</p>

<p>Birds have sharp ears and can hear bugs and worms
long before they can be seen. The woodpecker listens
for the grubs with his ear close to the bark of the trees.
But woodpeckers are not always after grubs when you
see them running up and down a tree trunk and pecking
holes in the bark. They like the inner skin of the
bark for food, and the sap-suckers drink the sap of the
tree.</p>

<p>Watch the robin or the mocking-bird on the lawn.
You have been sprinkling that lawn for two weeks in
midsummer, just to make the grass nice and green.
Perhaps you did not think that you were making it
easy for the birds to get something to eat in a dry time.
But you see that your sprinkling or watering has made
the turf mellow and soft, so that the worms can crawl
up to the surface more easily than if it were dry. And
the birds are making the most of your kindness, as you
see.</p>

<p>See how that little bird cants his head and listens.
We imagine him holding up his hand and saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42 ]</a></span>
"Don't move, please, nor do anything to scare this
worm away. I hear it coming up to the top of the
ground, and I am very hungry."</p>

</div>


<p>Once we saw a very funny sight. A mocking-bird
in the yard had grown very tame and had nested close
by, taking no pains to fly away from us. She soon
came to know that we had something for her to eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43 ]</a></span>
when we called, "Come, Chickie," and she would fly
close to us with eager eyes, not at all afraid.</p>

<p>Every night at sundown, which is the bird's supper-time,
we went to the summer-house and turned over
the empty flower-pots. Under these pots little black
bugs were hiding, but more especially the saw-bugs,
soft, gray, crawling things. The mocking-bird would
follow us as fast as she could, picking up the bugs for
her young. When she had a mouth full of the wriggling
insects, she would go and feed them to her babies
and come back again to the moist places under the pots,
until every bug was captured.</p>

<p>Once there were more bugs under one pot than she
could possibly carry at one time, and she was in great
trouble to know what to do about it. She swallowed
as many as she wanted herself, and then she began
cramming her mouth full for the babies. The bugs
looked so tempting, and there were so many, she did
not like to lose any of them, and so she kept on picking
them up. After her mouth was as full as it could hold,
the bugs kept falling out at the sides of her bill, and she
would pick them up again over and over without knowing
it, until we scared her away by our laughing.</p>

<p>Some birds, as we have said, such as the owls, take
their food whole. Of course, bones, hair, and feathers
cannot be digested, so after a time they are thrown up
in the shape of little balls, called "castings," and by
examining them we can find out exactly what the bird
has been eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the birds we are acquainted with pick their
food very carefully, and eat only that which will digest
without trouble. You can see them hold it down with
one foot, looking at it closely to be quite sure that it
is really good to eat. They often pull it to shreds and
swallow it in little bits. If it is a butterfly dinner,
the wings are torn off and sent floating to the ground.
If it is a grasshopper supper, the tough, wiry legs of
the insect are thrown away, and only the rich, luscious
breast and fat thighs are eaten.</p>

<p>In California we have the pepper tree, which is all
covered with clusters of red berries. Under the thin,
red skin is a sweet, soft pulp which covers the seed.
The pulp is all there is of the pepper berry which the
birds can digest. But this is a very sweet morsel indeed,
and tourist birds come a long distance to get it.</p>

<p>Robin redbreasts,<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> come here in winter to eat our
pepper berries, and then, of course, they disgorge the
hard seeds, which they cannot possibly digest, just as
the owls do the bones of their prey.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <i>Merula migratoria propinqua.</i></p></div>

<p>We think the mocking-birds have taught the robins
to do this, and we have noticed the wax-wings<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> doing
the same thing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> <i>Ampelis cedrorum.</i></p></div>

<p>When the winter tourist birds make a raid on our
yards, we can hear the tiny pepper seeds fall in a
shower on our tin roofs, under the tall trees, and the
door-steps will be covered. Sometimes the seeds come
down so thick and fast that we can think of nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45 ]</a></span>
but a hail-storm. The pepper berries ripen in midwinter,
and it is worth one's while to see a flock of
robins and wax-wings come into our yard. In a few
days almost every pepper tree has been robbed, and
nothing is left us but the brown seeds.</p>

<p>These, and other birds from the north who come to
pay us a visit in winter, are tamer than they are at
home. They seem to think that we are on our honor
to be polite to strangers, and so we are.</p>

<p>If you watch closely, wherever you live, at some time
in the year you will see visiting birds in your yard and
you ought to be polite to them.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">SEED-EATERS AND MEAT-EATERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we wish to keep one of the wild birds in a cage,
we usually select one of the seed-eaters. These birds
are gentle and are readily tamed. Our tame canaries
are descended from the wild seed-eaters.</p>

<p>Seed-eating birds make us think of some nations of
men who live on rice or fruit. Those who have been
among these people tell us that they are gentle and
kind and ready to learn.</p>

<p>Many birds are very fond of spiders. It is said that
spiders are a kind of "bird medicine," and that some
birds could not live without them. This seems rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46 ]</a></span>
hard for the spiders, but sometimes they pay the birds
back. There is said to be a spider in a certain part of
the world which is so large and strong that it eats
birds. It lies in wait and catches small, weak birds
as if they were so many flies. This seems very cruel,
because we love the birds so much. But we might
learn to love the spiders just as well, if we should get
better acquainted with them.</p>

<p>When you are outdoors just after sundown, you will
sometimes see a great many swifts and swallows in the
air, darting around in great circles. They do not seem
to be going anywhere or doing anything in particular.
But you will find that they really have something very
important on hand. They are eating their late suppers.</p>

<p>There are tiny insects high up where the birds are
flying, whole swarms of them, and these make a delicious
supper for the hungry birds.</p>

</div>

<p>The finches, or wild canaries,<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as we call them in
Southern California, are among our commonest birds.
These birds shell plant-seeds before swallowing them,
as one can see by watching flocks of them in the sunflower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48 ]</a></span>
patches. We have thrown hard crumbs out to
them in the yard, and they have been seen to crack
these crumbs all to pieces, thinking of course that there
must be a shell.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> <i>Spinus psaltria</i> and <i>Spinus tristis</i>.</p></div>

<p>The birds do not crack or break their teeth or beaks,
be the seeds ever so hard, as a child would be very
likely to do on a walnut. Every bird carries a nutcracker
about with him wherever he goes. If a finch
gets hold of a very tough, hard seed, he slips it far
back in the beak, where the angle of the jaw gives
better strength or force. He can then break it easily,
as you would crack the hardest nut by placing it close
to the hinge of the nutcracker.</p>

<p>If the seed is tender or brittle, the bird pushes it to
the point of his beak with his tongue and presses on it.
Out drops the seed-cover to the ground, leaving the
meat in the bird's bill.</p>

<p>Our tame canary has an original way of preparing
his food. We give him cookie or bread, and he breaks
off bits and carries them to his water dish, into which
he drops them. After they have soaked a little while,
he goes back and picks them out and eats them. Now
his teeth are not at all poor, for he cracks his canary
seeds without any trouble. We think he likes a little
mush for a change, and so he makes it for himself.</p>

<p>One sometimes wonders why our garden birds do not
store away food when it is plentiful, as squirrels do.
There are ever so many nice hiding-places all about.
Some wild birds do hide their food, thus "laying up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49 ]</a></span>
something for a rainy day," which we think is about
the right thing for birds and other people to do.</p>

<p>One reason why our civilized birds do not store their
food is that a supply of one kind or another is almost
always to be found. Besides, many of our birds travel
about so much, always going where food is, that there
is no need of storing it.</p>

<p>The seed-eaters do not travel much, as seeds may
always be found, in winter as well as in summer.
Birds that depend for food upon insect life must go in
search of it as the seasons change.</p>

<p>One sometimes thinks the birds do little else but
think about meal-time. A singer will sometimes
"make believe" forget, while he sits on his swaying
branch, pouring out his throat full of melody, as if he
did not care if he never tasted food again. But suddenly,
without a hint, there is a stop in the music that
doesn't belong just there, and the bird darts to the
ground. He swallows a worm or a blue-jacketed fly,
and then back he goes to his perch and his song, as if
he had not been interrupted at all.</p>

<p>We do not think it is the worst fate in the world to
be eaten by a bird and made into song and chirp and
flutter. We owe a good deal to the insects, which the
birds we love so much could not do without. We
ought to think of this and not step on a bug or worm
in the path.</p>

<p>Some heartless people think it is a great treat to
have a pot-pie made of as many little birds as they can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50 ]</a></span>
get by paying for them or shooting them,&mdash;birds so
small that it takes a whole one to make a good mouthful.</p>

<p>We do not think it wrong to have a chicken dinner,
or even a quail or pigeon, if we are sick; because it
takes only a bird or two to make enough. But we do
think it is wrong to take many happy lives just to give
one person a dinner, when he could make as good a
meal on beefsteak as on a dozen little birds.</p>

<p>Birds have so many enemies that they hardly ever
die of old age. We ought to think of this, and do
what we can to prolong their lives. There is hardly a
spot on earth so desolate that birds are not found there.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">SOME BIRDS WITH A BAD NAME.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> name is what we all want in this world.
We like to have people speak well of us behind our
backs. There are a few birds which have a bad name.
Sometimes they deserve what is said of them, and sometimes
they are quite innocent. It is always well for
us to find out for ourselves if what we hear about birds
is quite true.</p>

<p>There is a king-bird or bee-martin. Farmers think
him a very wicked little fellow, catching the bees on
the wing and eating greedily whole swarms of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51 ]</a></span>
Mr. Farmer has not yet found out everything about the
bee-martin, or he would know that he eats a good many
enemies of the bees, even if he does swallow a few of
the bees themselves.</p>

<div id="fig_15" class="fig_center" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/fig_15.png" width="438" height="376" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">King-Bird.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We once saw these birds around our beehive and
felt certain that they were eating the bees. They
would dart close to the hives, snapping their bills and
looking very savage. But we were willing to watch a
long while, that we might be certain if we were not
mistaken, and we did just right.</p>

<p>There was some tall grass near the hives, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52 ]</a></span>
noticed swarms of strange looking black-and-blue flies
all over the grass. We saw these flies dart out to the
front of the hive and kill the bees faster than the birds
could have done it.</p>

<p>Waiting a little longer, we found that the birds were
on the watch for these flies, and it was these they were
catching instead of the bees at that particular time.</p>

<p>A certain naturalist, who has spent a good deal of
time trying to find out if the bee-birds do really kill
bees, has told us a little secret, which is very interesting
and may lead some other people to investigate the
matter. He says that he has never found a worker-bee
in the stomach of a bee-bird, though he has examined
a great many of them. He has found only drones,
which the worker bees are very glad to get rid of and
often kill, because they are lazy and eat honey without
gathering any for winter.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason why the bee-bird prefers the
drone to the worker is because the drones have no
stings.</p>

<p>By all this you see that it pays us to take some
trouble to find out all the good there is about anybody.</p>

<p>However, it cannot be denied that the king-birds do
eat bees, when they can find nothing they like better.
We have often wondered what they do with so many
stings, and why they are not poisoned by them. We
have not examined a king-bird's throat to find out this
secret, but a friend of ours did look at the throat of a
toad which persisted in eating his bees on warm summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53 ]</a></span>
evenings. This man found a good many stings on the
side of the toad's throat, which had caught there when
he swallowed the bees. Stings are probably not poisonous
to toads and bee-birds.</p>

<p>Hardly anybody speaks a good word for the butcher-bird
or shrike.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Yet this bird is not half so bad as
most people think he is. It is true that he has been
caught a few times in doing very naughty things, such
as making a dinner on a small chicken, or on birds
weaker than himself.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> <i>Lanius ludovicianus.</i></p></div>

<p>But his most common food consists of insects, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54 ]</a></span>
Jerusalem crickets. This great yellow cricket
is an inch or two inches long, and he looks as bad as
he is reported to be, for he wears a suit of clothes with
brown and yellow stripes, running around, instead of
up and down in the usual way for stripes. This makes
one think of a convict or a convict's suit of clothes.</p>

<p>Now the shrike, or butcher-bird, does us a great
favor by making as many meals as he can of these
great crickets. These crickets are the fellows that dig
holes in our potatoes while they are in the ground and
bite the roots off from our pansies and other plants.
The butcher-bird also eats grasshoppers and beetles,
and other enemies to our roots and grains. So we see
that he is more our friend than our enemy.</p>

<p>This bird, which we have all learned to despise so
much, could teach us a good lesson in his line of work,
for he is a very merciful and kind butcher. He is in
the habit of killing his victim quickly, and does not
hang it up alive on a thorn, as some people think he
does. He probably fastens his dinner in that way that
he may pull it to pieces easier and know where to find
it when he is hungry again.</p>

<p>The English sparrow<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is another bird that has a bad
name, and he deserves what is said of him more than
some of the other birds. He is quarrelsome and selfish
and very unlovable. But in spite of this we have
sometimes put him to a good use, and have grown to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55 ]</a></span>
look upon the little tyrant as quite capable of adding
to the comfort of our families.</p>

<p>Once there was a sick child in our family, and we
happened to think that the sparrow would make a good
supper for our little invalid. The birds were "small
fry," to be sure, but we cooked them, and they were
good eating.</p>

</div>

<p>Then we gathered all the sparrows' eggs we could
reach every morning, and cooked them. They were
delicious. We felt that it was not wrong for us to
take a good many of these eggs, for there were countless
more.</p>

<p>We found that we could tempt the hen birds to lay
their eggs close to the door, by placing hay above the
sills and around the window corners, just as you would
make a hen's nest for Mistress Biddy.</p>

<p>This disposition of the English sparrow to become
domesticated, like our hens, once came near making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56 ]</a></span>
trouble in money matters. Captain R. H. Pratt, of
the Carlisle Indian School, noting that the sparrows
were driving all the other birds away from the school
grounds, offered a penny a set for all the eggs which
should be brought to him.</p>

<p>The little Indian students, two hundred or more of
them, made a raid on the grounds, and brought so
many eggs to the captain that he began to think he
should have no money left. He thought, "Surely there
cannot be so many nests as there are sets of eggs." So
he set himself to work to find out the secret.</p>

<p>It had not taken the boys long to learn that Mrs.
Sparrow would lay right along, just like a hen, if the
nest itself were not destroyed. The eggs were taken
out cautiously as often as four or five were laid, and
the industrious little Indian claimed his reward. It
was a good scheme at money-making, but the alert
superintendent soon found it out, and of course took
back his offer. There was no more bounty given for
sparrows' eggs that summer.</p>

<p>California farmers complain a good deal about the
linnets.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> One man whom we know spent whole days
in March killing the linnets, because he thought they
were eating up his peach buds. In late summer we
went over to see him, and what do you think he was
doing? We found him pulling off half of the little
peaches and throwing them on the ground.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Housefinch, <i>Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis</i>.</p></div>

<p>"Good morning, sir," we said, stopping at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57 ]</a></span>
street along the edge of the field. "What are you
doing?"</p>

<p>He looked up and answered, "Oh, I am thinning out
the peaches. They are too thick on the boughs, and
they will grow larger if there are only half as many
left. We always have to thin them out in this way
before fall."</p>

<p>"But, sir," we said, "don't you think it would have
saved you some trouble if you had let the linnets thin
the peaches for you in the spring? They would have
eaten more insects than peaches, too, and not have
charged you a dollar for all their work."</p>

<p>The man looked surprised and scratched his head in
a sorry sort of way. Then he said, "Why, I never
thought of that. I was told that the linnets do a great
deal of damage. I will get them to take care of my
peach orchard next year. I am sorry I made such a
mistake."</p>

<p class="caption3nb">BEFORE BREAKFAST.</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ring</span> the breakfast bell," cried Madam Towhee,
"the sun is nearly up. Rap on your tree, Mr. Flicker,
and wake up the linnets."</p>

<p>"You are late yourself, Mrs. Towhee," said Mrs.
Linnet; "my children have had their breakfast already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Flicker opened his sharp eyes and admired his
sharp tail shafts. Then he peeped from behind his
tree and called out, "Mr. Mocker kept me awake an
hour in the night serenading young Mr. and Mrs.
Sparrow. That is why I slept so late."</p>

<div id="fig_18" class="fig_center" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/fig_18.png" width="430" height="356" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Brown Towhee.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Mocker, in the top of his house, rang the breakfast
bell. It sounded like the linnet and the towhee
and the flicker and the robin all together. The mocker
laughed, too, like a dozen birds, keeping his clapper
going until the other people in the yard could scarcely
hear their own voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Up jumped little Mrs. Humming-bird and snatched a
dewdrop from the cup of a morning-glory on the
trellis. "I prefer to drink distilled water," she said,
wiping her mouth.</p>

<p>"I like to drink from the hydrant," said Madam
Linnet. "Any water is good enough for me." Then
she tilted herself on the top of the hydrant and swallowed
three drops as they fell from the pipe.</p>

<p>"What makes you always turn a somersault on the
top of the hydrant?" asked Mrs. Towhee. "It doesn't
look polite to stoop over like that, and drink with your
head down."</p>

<p>"I don't drink with my mouth on the edge of the
cup, like some people I know," she said in reply to Mrs.
Towhee. "Besides, it doesn't wet my face' when the
drops fall right into my mouth like this. I like to turn
upside down, too; it is good exercise for the muscles.
What's the use of a bird always being so proper?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Mrs. Sparrow, "see how I drink."
And she stood on the edge of the puddle under the
hydrant, and laid her breast in the water, and drank,
and drank, wetting her face and throat all over. "I'm
not afraid of a wetting," she said.</p>

<p>"What's all this talk about drinking?" asked old
Mr. Butcher-bird, coming down on the party with a
swoop of his wings that scared all the other birds back
to the trees. "Don't run away," he said kindly.
"I've had my breakfast." Then he began to pull tatters
of lizard meat out of his bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you suppose I got that lizard?" he asked
of a goldfinch.</p>

<p>"I have no idea," she answered. "I never saw a
lizard up in the morning so early as this. Lizards are
'sun birds' and don't like cold, wet grass."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the butcher. "I caught him yesterday
asleep, and killed him, and pinned him on a
thorn. I always get my breakfast ready over night."</p>

<p>"I wish I had some wine to drink," observed Mr.
Oriole, sadly. "The doctor says I ought to drink wine,
I feel so weak."</p>

<p>"What do you know about wine?" asked old Mr.
Warbler, hopping along where the birds were talking.
"I tasted some wine once from a broken bottle at the
back door of a dram-shop, and it made me so dizzy I
couldn't fly. I had to stay on the shed roof all the
morning, feeling so foolish, and expecting to be caught
by a cat any minute. I wouldn't drink wine."</p>

<p>"I would, whole bottles of it," declared Mr. Oriole,
laughing till he almost cried. Then all the frightened
birds came back to the hydrant.</p>

<p>"Too bad! too bad!" cried the warbler, wiping his
eyes. "Young man, you will be sorry. I wouldn't
have anything to do with a doctor who advised a young
man to drink wine because he felt weak. Better go
out in the field to work."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the oriole again, amused at his
own joke. "See me tap my wine bottles." Then he
flew to the berry patch and sipped the red juice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61 ]</a></span>
ripe raspberries, until his mouth and downy moustache
were all stained, the little winebibber.</p>

<p>"A pretty drinker you are," said the mocker; "give
us a treat."</p>

<p>Then all the other birds fell to tapping the berry
bottles, till a lady came out of the house and cried,
"Shoo!" flirting her gingham apron at them and rattling
her tin pail against the sunflower stalks in a way
that made the birds know she was in earnest. Then
the lady began filling her pail, while the birds watched
her from behind the leaves.</p>

<p>"Keep still," said Mr. Robin; "she'll never see them
all. There'll be plenty left. There are always more
under the leaves. Let's go off to the strawberry bed."</p>

<p>So the birds flew off to the strawberry bed on the
other side of the garden, and picked the ripe red side
out of ever so many of the berries. Then a man came
out of the house and cried, "Shoo!" just as the lady
had done. But he did not begin to pick the berries.
He stuck a great ugly scarecrow up in the middle of
the strawberry bed, and laughed to himself as he
thought how scared the birds would be when they
saw it.</p>

<p>But the birds, sitting in the trees, laughed too, and
gay old Mr. Mocker said, "He can't deceive us. We
know a scarecrow from a man any day."</p>

<p>As soon as the man's back was turned, the birds
came down and chattered in the scarecrow's face, and
sat on the rim of his hat, and wiped their bills on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62 ]</a></span>
coat sleeve, and made themselves very well acquainted
with him. All the while the man in the house was
saying to his daughter, "I guess those birds will let
my strawberries alone now."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">OUR BIRDS' RESTAURANT.&mdash;MEALS AT ALL HOURS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day in the middle of winter some one suggested
that we set up a "Birds' Restaurant" out on the lawn.
It was such a funny idea that we had to laugh. After
we were done laughing, we went to work, while the
birds watched us, as they always do, expecting some
surprise.</p>

<p>We set a rustic table under a tree by the summer-house.
Then came the question, "What shall we put
on it?" We imagined the birds all about were making
remarks, and suggesting in an undertone, "Just what
you eat, if you please." We remembered that the birds
in our yard are civilized birds, and so of course we gave
them civilized food.</p>

<p>If you are not well acquainted with the birds, we
suppose you will be amused at our mention of bread
and butter. But the birds make food a "matter of
taste," like other people. They have learned to like
the flavor of things they never dreamed of eating when
they were wild, just as some races of men leave off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63 ]</a></span>
eating raw flesh and eat cooked foods when they have
been to school a while.</p>

<p>We rolled some cracker crumbs very fine. Then we
crumbled a couple of seed cookies, and chopped some
walnuts into bits. Then we put some stewed blackberries
in a saucer, and a slice of bread and butter on a
plate.</p>

<p>This seemed to us like a pretty "square meal" for
February birds, and we stood back and smiled at the
spread. Some people passing in the street smiled too,
and asked if we were having "a picnic, such weather."
And we were sure we heard the birds twittering. Of
course chairs at our restaurant were out of the question,
things were gotten up in such a hurry, owing to
the "hard times" among the birds.</p>

<p>We stood behind a hedge and watched to see if company
would come. We were not disappointed. First
a pair of brown towhees<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> hopped along and up to the
edge of the table. They did not even look for chairs,
but went straight for the blackberries, pecking away at
the sweet morsels until they were all gone, and then
looking as if they could have taken more.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Pipilo fuscus senicula.</span></p></div>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Towhee," we said, "you had better put
up a few cans of blackberries for yourself next summer,
if you think they are so nice." She made no answer,
but looked as if she expected us to put up enough for
ourselves and her too.</p>

<p>Then along came the sparrows.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64 ]</a></span>
bread and butter and cracker crumbs. They actually
picked the butter from the bread, just as all children
do who are very fond of butter, feeling sure of another
"spread"' when that is gone. In less than an hour
that table was cleared of every bit of food. The linnets
took the walnuts and what was left of the cookies.
Our birds' restaurant was a success. If we could
have charged them the regular price for their meals,
we should have made money at the business. But
though we knew that they had pockets, we had never
heard of their carrying money about with them, and so
we said nothing about it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65 ]</a></span></p>

<p>All we ever received from our little guests by way
of payment was song and twitter and pleasant company
in the cold, sad part of the year, but we thought that
was good pay.</p>

<p>We set the table over and over again during the cold
spell, watching from the windows when it rained. The
birds cared little if the crumbs were wet. Every winter
since then we have remembered to do the same thing;
and even in summer, especially in nesting time, we
do not forget the restaurant.</p>

<p>We usually set the table at night, the last thing
before going to bed, as some careful and busy house-wives
do, and you should hear and see the fun at sunrise.
The table will be all covered with birds of every
size and color living near, and they are as good-natured
as can be. Food by the saucerful disappears in almost
a twinkling, and the birds surround the empty board
when they are done, tamer than ever, and asking in
coaxing tones for "more."</p>

<p>There have come to be more birds in that corner of
the yard than anywhere else, just as you see a street
thronged at meal-time about a popular eating-house in
the city. We have learned a great deal about the
tastes of different birds. Some of them have a "sweet
tooth" as truly as any child, for they always choose the
cookies or gingerbread.</p>

<p>One day we thought we would see how far they really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66 ]</a></span>
were civilized in the matter of diet, and so we laid a
mutton bone on the table. It was a bone that had been
cooked, and had just a suspicion of meat on it left
from our own dinner.</p>

<p>Along came the birds, of course, for they were always
watching us, canting their heads to get a good look at
the strange object. "What do you suppose it is?"
they seemed to be asking each other. "Do you think
it is safe to taste?"</p>

<p>But they seemed to remember that we never played
a joke on them when they were hungry, and in a little
while a sparrow pecked daintily at the bone. After
this they all fell to eating the meat as fast as they
could.</p>

<p>That was not the last bone that found its way to the
birds' restaurant. Now we put the bones all about
in the apple trees, or swing them on a string from the
branches. It is great fun. If you can spare a large
beef bone that has some marrow in it, just offer it to
the birds in some quiet place. The first bird that gets
to it will put his head in at the round tunnel in the
middle of the bone, where the marrow is hidden, and
you can come pretty near putting "salt on his tail"
without his knowing what you are about.</p>

<p>You have all read that queer song Mother Goose
made about the "blackbird pie." But that was a
pleasant joke. The birds were never baked at all.
They were put under the crust alive and well, just to
surprise a great dinner party. It was only for ornament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67 ]</a></span>
as we put flowers in a vase and set them on the
table. Shut up in the dark, in a great earthen pot,
with just enough air for breathing coming in at the
small holes pricked in the crust, it was no wonder the
"birds began to sing" when the cover was lifted. Of
course they all began to fly around the room, they were
so glad to be free once more and to find that they were
not "baked in a pie" at all.</p>

<p>It was a merry surprise for a great dinner party, and
quite satisfactory, since there was plenty of food to eat
besides blackbird pie. We never look at a field of
blackbirds without thinking of the old rhyme and stopping
to count the birds, just to see if there are exactly
"twenty-four."</p>

<p>Here is a bit of rhyme in imitation of Mother Goose,
which we fancy will fit very well when birds are bigger
than boys and have pot-pie for dinner.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">UMBRELLAS AND OTHER THINGS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is more fun than you can imagine in watching
the birds in your yard for just one single day. If
you are a sick child and cannot go to school, the day
will never seem long when once you have begun to get
acquainted with these dear little people. If you look
a bird straight in the eye when you have a chance to
hold one in your hand, you cannot hurt him if you have
a bit of a kind heart in your jacket.</p>

<p>Birds' faces are sweet and happy and beautiful, even
if they are covered with feathers. You will notice
that they have different expressions at different times.
But a bird's eye, whether it is black, or red, or white,
will tell the story of its fear or happiness as plainly as
your own. You may wonder how that can be, when
there are no wrinkles to be seen about the face.</p>

<p>We have seen birds do a great many bright things,
and we have seen them do stupid things as well.
There are wide cracks in our woodshed, and the towhees
go through these cracks to the inside in search of something
to eat, or just out of curiosity.</p>

<p>When we open the shed door suddenly, the birds are
in a great fright. They seem to have forgotten just
where they came in, and they flutter about to all the
cracks, trying to squeeze their way through, until they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69 ]</a></span>
find the right one. They do this almost every day,
never learning to count or to mark the crack in any
way. This is very stupid of the towhees, and we laugh
at their shrill squeaks, and their silly way of trying
every hole without regard to their size.</p>

<p>These towhees are full of curiosity. There is a rabbit's
cage in the yard, and the birds try all day to get
in. Sometimes we leave the door ajar, and in they hop.
Then what a time. Squealing and fluttering, they fly
about as if they were scared nearly to death. We let
them out again, and they will hop to a log near by
and preen themselves, and in five minutes they have
forgotten what happened. Back they fly to the cage
again, and are not satisfied till they find a way to
get in.</p>

<p>They wait coaxingly about the door, as if they would
give anything for a ticket of admission. Once a curious
little towhee squeezed itself into the owl's cage,
and we had hard work to get it out alive; and then
what should the stupid little thing do but go straight
for the canary's cage, hanging under a tree on the lawn.
If we want to hold a towhee in our hands for any reason,
we have but to set a cage on the grass with the door
open, and in a few minutes we have the bird.</p>

<p>We are reminded of something about birds which
John Webster wrote more than two hundred years ago.
He must have been a bird lover. When speaking of
a summer bird-cage in a garden, he observed, "The
birds that are without, despair to get in; and the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70 ]</a></span>
that are within, despair for fear they will never get
out."</p>

<p>Did you ever stand at the window when it is raining
and wonder what the birds do without umbrellas? Of
course you have, but you are a little mistaken if you
suppose they do not have umbrellas and parasols.
Their umbrellas are all about, in the trees and fence
corners and bushes, just where they are needed.</p>

<p>See the birds cuddle under a bunch of leaves during
a smart shower. See them hunt for the shadiest places
when the sun shines warm. Of course they do not
carry their umbrellas about with them, tucked under
their arms, but they fly quickly to places where they
are sure the umbrellas are to be found.</p>

<p>Once in February a humming-bird built her frail
little nest close to the path on the low limb of a tree
in our yard. Now this eucalyptus tree was very nearly
a hundred feet high, and we wondered that the bird
built so near the ground, when she might have been so
far above. We liked to fancy that she suspected we
would not harm her, and that we might possibly help
her some if she should happen to be in trouble. She
was right, for we did help her in a way we could not
have done had she built her nest in the top of the tree.</p>

<p>A fierce hail storm came down from the mountains,
and we knew the eggs would be destroyed if we did
not protect them. There sat the tiny mother on her
frail nest, the great drops of water running off from
the point of her slender bill and down over her soft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[ 71 ]</a></span>
small sides. We felt very sorry, but you know that
just feeling sorry for those who are in trouble doesn't
help them very much. So we went to the attic and
found an old sunshade which we had put away under
the rafters at the close of the summer. We thought it
would be just the thing, and so it was.</p>

<p>We tied it to a twig just above the hummer's nest.
The mother flew off just for a moment, but came right
back. Then she looked at the black roof over the nest
and settled down on her eggs quite satisfied, while we
stood close by her, wet to the skin in the rain and
sleet. It was a long storm, lasting until the eggs were
hatched, but the mother was safe, and the baby birds
were never wet at all. Since then we have looked all
about the yard for humming-birds' nests just before a
storm, that we might shelter them.</p>

<p>You have noticed that there are different birds about
your yard at different times in the year. Birds are
like other people, they like to travel and see the world.
They like to visit their friends and get something to
eat different from what they have at home.</p>

<p>But birds are very sensible people. They do not
pack a valise or a great trunkful of clothes when they
go on a long journey. They have one good travelling
dress, and they keep that tidy. When they get to the
end of their trip, they do not have to annoy their friends
with baggage. Probably their visit is all the more
welcome. And their visits are usually short. It seems
as if they do not want to wear out their welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course you have wondered how birds travel, never
needing a street, or a railroad track, or a bicycle, or a
boat. Perhaps the birds wonder, too, how it is that we
never take a flight up into the blue sky, or rest ourselves
in the trees, always keeping on the ground in
the grass or dust, or in our houses. Perhaps they
puzzle their tiny brains to know how it is that we can
walk so far without getting tired, and how it is that
we are obliged to climb a tree on all fours, like a bear
or a squirrel, if we wish to get the nuts which are far
up out of reach.</p>

<p>There is no telling what the birds think about us.
The same Great One who made the birds with hollow
bones and quills, and who filled many little cells of
their bodies with air, so that the little creatures might
be light of weight and buoyant to fly, also made us of
heavier weight and greater strength of muscle.</p>

<p>The birds are not inventors, but man has invented
the steam-engine, and the bicycle, and the sail-boat, so
that we have come as near flying as we possibly can
without being birds.</p>

<p>Almost every boy tries to fly, and he thinks there is
some secret about it which he can find out, if he is only
patient enough. He gets up on a high fence, and he
flaps his arms for wings, and he plays that he is going
to fly to the next town. The birds, looking on, must
laugh heartily.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the boy's body were boat-shaped, like a
bird's body, and if his legs were put midway between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73 ]</a></span>
the two ends of his body like a bird's legs, the boy
would come nearer flying. But more than all, he would
need a good strong pair of wings. We have never
seen a boy yet who had wings of any sort.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">CRADLE MAKING.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a good deal said and written about the way
birds build their houses. But, really, birds do not
build houses. Their houses or dwellings are built for
them by Mother Nature, and are the trees and the
bushes, and the sheltering rocks and the caves, and
the cornices of our own houses.</p>

<p>What birds really do build are their cradles,&mdash;little
crib beds, sometimes with rockers and sometimes without.</p>

<p>Birds do not make the cradle first and put the rockers
on afterwards, as a cabinet-maker would do. They first
choose the best rockers in the market, and then make
the cradle on top of the rockers. Sometimes they do a
very queer thing; they find the rockers, and then build
the cradle under them. Birds have ways of their own,
and they are very good ways, as you shall see.</p>

<p>The rockers for a bird's cradle are of the branches of
the sycamore, or apple or orange trees, or they are of
twigs of the elm or cypress, or banana leaves. Any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74 ]</a></span>
strong, firm twig or branch that will rock and tilt in
the breeze, makes a good rocker of the old-fashioned
sort.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the wind blows the cradle will rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down comes baby, cradle and all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it is a very hard wind that can break one of
these rocker boughs or blow a bird's cradle out of its
place. Sometimes a crib is blown out of the elbow of
a tree, because the nest in the elbow is not fastened by
string, as it is in a bough, but is just tucked in between
the great branches.</p>

<p>Birds are very wise and select their boughs with
great care. Lithe, yielding branches are just right for
rockers, they will spring and swing so readily. Sometimes
a young twig and a strong old twig, joined
together, make a pair of bird rockers.</p>

<p>A cradle of this kind is very handy for the mother
bird. The wind rocks the babies to sleep, and the
leaves sing lullaby songs, while the mother blinks
away on the nest or goes off in search of food.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mother herself sings the babies to
sleep, sitting in the cradle with them. Some of the
finches twitter a low musical song over their little ones,
and we have often found their nests by hearing these
soft, sweet notes. One must listen as well as look, to
learn these pleasant secrets.</p>

<p>Some mother birds do not approve of rockers for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75 ]</a></span>
babies. These are very sensible mothers. They make
their cradles in the firm, still crotch of a tree, high
up among the forked branches, or lower, right in the
hollow trunk. Other birds choose the ground or low
shrubs.</p>

<div id="fig_20" class="fig_center" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/fig_20.png" width="429" height="356" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Baltimore Oriole.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Some cradles, like those of the oriole and titmouse,
are curtained all around with beautiful lace fibre or lattice
work. Other cribs have no curtains at all except
drooping leaves and waving grass.</p>

<p>Those of us who can afford them have eider-down
quilts on our beds. But these are rare and costly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76 ]</a></span>
not many people have them. Birds do not have to
think about the cost of anything. There must be
downy quilts in every nursery. These crib blankets
are always on hand. Sometimes they are soft gray or
brown in color, and sometimes they are "crazy quilts."
It all depends upon what sort of a breast the mother
bird has.</p>

<p>At first thought one might fear that such a quilt
might be too heavy. You see the old bird fly to the
nest and settle quickly down above her young, as if
she took her seat right on their frail little backs. She
does not take the trouble to explain to you that her
feet are below and between the young birds, and that
she lifts her feathers gently. She is really a very fluffy
"comfortable," soothing and warm, covering the delicate
birds, or the still more delicate eggs.</p>

<p>Some birds, like the hummers, build their cradles of
material which is just the color of the branch or the
rockers upon which they rest. We have seen hummer's
nests on orange trees covered on the outside with
the black scales which are so frequent on these trees.
We have seen them on the sycamore trees all covered
with the light yellow wool which grows on the backs
of the sycamore leaves. The birds do this that the
nests may look like a part of the branch on which they
rest. In this way these shrewd little creatures hope
to deceive the shrikes and owls and hawks and boys.
It is not easy to find a nest that looks just like everything
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[ 77 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The ground owl<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is a queer bird. She does not
select a swinging branch or a crotch of a tree for her
babies; but she takes possession of a ground squirrel's
hole and lays her eggs there. So you see it is rather a
bed than a cradle. If you are in luck, you will find
the nest of the ground owl in the ground from four to
twenty feet away from the hole or doorway. It may
not be more than a few inches under the surface of the
ground, but it is hard to know just where to strike it.</p>

</div>

<p>When a merry schoolboy gets a spade and flings his
jacket off and begins in good earnest to dig out a
ground owl, take our word for it, he has a good piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78 ]</a></span>
of work on his hands. Ten to one he will dig till sundown,
and go home tired and cross, with nothing to
show for his pains. Mr. Owl, just an inch or two from
the tip of the spade, is no doubt holding on to his sides
with laughter, if owls ever do laugh in that way.</p>

<p>The nest of the ground owl is not much of an affair,
only some coarse stuff lining the hollow at the end of
this long hole. Mrs. Owl is lazy, and can leave her
eggs in this warm place a long time and be sure that
they will not chill. She pays her rent to the squirrels
by eating any little squirrels she can lay hands on.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">OUR SCREECH OWL.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Speaking</span> of owls reminds us of a pet screech owl
which once happened to belong to us. One evening
in midsummer we heard a thump against the screen in
front of the fireplace, as if something rather soft had
fallen down the chimney. Of course we hurried to see
what it could be, and there was a small mouse, not at
all hurt.</p>

<p>We caught it as soon as we could, and found that it
was covered with soot from its long, dark journey.
Then we began guessing how it happened to get into
the chimney-top. There was no possible way for it to
do this except by being carried there by some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79 ]</a></span>
creature. We at once suspected that an owl had
caught the mouse and taken it to the top of the chimney
to eat. Here the mouse had managed to escape,
falling down the long, gloomy shaft. This was what
we imagined, you know.</p>

<div id="fig_22" class="fig_center" style="width: 464px;">
<img src="images/fig_22.png" width="464" height="519" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Screech Owl.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning we were under the trees in the garden,
when all the birds in another part of the yard commenced
such a clatter that we ran to find out the cause.
It was a funny sight and a droll sound. There were
the mocking-birds, and the sparrows, and the linnets,
and the finches, and the bush-tits, and, last and least,
the tiny humming-birds, each and all screaming at the
top of their voices and hopping about in a certain tree.</p>

<p>We knew in a moment there must be an enemy there,
and began to search for him. The birds were not
afraid, but flew toward us, looking us in the face, while
they screamed louder than before. By this we knew
that we must be very near the enemy.</p>

<p>It did not take much hunting to find the cause of
the uproar. On a low branch of the tree sat a screech
owl,<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> blinking away sleepily. He was not at all embarrassed
by so many callers, nor frightened by their noise.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Megascops asio bendirei.</span></p></div>

<p>One of us reached up behind the bird and took hold
of him around the legs and tail, grabbing him firmly,
so that he could not bite or get away. Then we brought
an unused robin's cage and put the owl in it. He
began to spit at us, as a cat does when it is angry or
frightened, and this excited the birds all the more.
They followed us while we took the cage to the back
door-steps, and then they took their places on the
clothes-line and the pump and the bushes near by,
chirping and scolding in a bustling way that was quite
laughable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81 ]</a></span></p>

<p>More birds came in from the neighboring yards, and
the din they all made grew so great that we had to shut
the owl in the woodshed. Then the birds seemed to
hold a council to talk the trouble over, and to devise
ways and means of getting rid of the enemy. At last
they seemed to settle the matter, and went away. But
we noticed a number of linnets and a mocker in sight,
as if they had been left in charge as spies, and spies
they were in fact.</p>

<p>As soon as we took the cage out again and attempted
to pet the owl and watch him, these spy birds gave a
shrill call, when back came all the other birds. We
carried the cage to the upper balcony, and the confusion
was the same. At last we left it in the shed.</p>

<p>This owl had doubtless caught the mouse the night
before and dropped it down our chimney, so we thought
we would keep him a while, to teach him better than to
be prowling around our house in the evening. His
feathers were very soft and thick, as are the feathers of
most owls. Being so soft, and able to fly without any
noise, the owls can catch their game on the sly, while
the hawks depend upon their swiftness for their food.
It makes no difference, when a hawk is on the hunt,
whether he makes a noise with his coarse feathers or
not; he knows that he can be quick enough to catch
his little victims, be they birds or mice.</p>

<p>Well, we kept that screech owl just as long as we
wanted his company. He was not a beautiful or an
interesting pet. In fact, he would not be petted at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82 ]</a></span>
He did cease to spit and growl at us in a day or two,
but he never seemed to return our good feeling or to
place any trust in us. He slept or blinked all day, and
when night came he was hungry. We taught him to
take pieces of raw beef from the end of a long stick, not
daring to give it to him from our fingers. He seemed to
enjoy this food. But what suited him best was mice.</p>

<p>We caught these mice in a trap in the grain bin, and
gave them to the owl only when they were dead. As
soon as the bird saw a mouse, he would snatch it
quickly and growl at it and shake it, and stick his
sharp claws through it, pinning it to the roost. It
would take him a long while, sometimes two or three
hours, to eat a whole mouse, but he never once let go
of it with his claws. He would tear it to pieces, skin
and all, and eat the shreds. He seemed to be obliged
to rest after each mouthful, going to sleep between
times, still clinging to what was left of his supper,
and growling if we tried to take it away from him.</p>

<p>After a while he would disgorge or throw up the
hard and hairy parts, and then he would take more of
his food.</p>

<p>We did not care to keep this owl, and so one evening
we let him fly away. He was seen in the yard many
times that summer, and the birds always told us where
he was, though they never made quite so much noise
as at first. They grew used to having him around.
He never lighted on so low a bough again, probably
remembering how he had been taken the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[ 83 ]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not care if he did choose to live in our yard,
for we knew very well his lazy habit of sleeping all
day. When he woke up at night we knew the little
birds would all be in bed. He was welcome to the
mice and the crickets and June bugs.</p>

<p>We are not fond of owls. It is dismal to hear their
"too-hoo, too-hoo," as they try to sing. We are glad
that they try, for even a poor song is better than no
song at all. Owls cannot sing any better than turkeys.
In fact, we prefer turkeys to owls for music. Don't
you?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">BIRDS AT WORK AND PLAY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> sounds very strange to speak of a bird at play.
But you can see that birds do play, if you will give
yourself the pleasure of watching them. They run
along under the hedges and fences at hide-and-seek.
They will stop suddenly and scold at one another for
not playing "fair"; and they actually play at leap-frog,
hopping over one another's backs, never once using
their hands.</p>

<p>Sometimes they play "tag" high up in the air, especially
the humming-birds and others of swift wing.
You can see them playing when they are so high that
they look like bumble-bees. Then perhaps they fly out
of sight in the blue of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84 ]</a></span></p>

<p>But the birds seem to do more work than play. It
is as if they were saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All play and no work<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Makes a bird a mere shirk."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Most father birds help their mates in the cradle
making, whenever they can get away for a few minutes
from the orchestra. But the mother has the care of
everything and does the most and the finest work.
We have sometimes thought the mother would do better
if left all to herself, the fathers are so fussy and awkward
at housekeeping.</p>

<p>Once, in the middle of winter, we saw a father linnet
trying his best to coax his mate to build a nest on a
little shelf on the upper balcony. He carried straws
in his bill, and sat on the shelf, and coaxed his mate
to his side, whispering to her, as if he were saying,
"How nice this is," and urging her to "Go right to
work." We guessed all that, you know, about their
talking together, while we stood and watched them
out of the window.</p>

<p>But the wise little mother bird just laughed provokingly
and flew away. We thought she was laughing,
for the father bird looked a little bit ashamed, and held
his head down, though he still clung to his straw and
remained for a while sitting on the little shelf. He
might have known that was no time or place to build a
cradle. It was midwinter, and besides the shelf was
slippery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It is common for a pair of birds to talk about
housekeeping, or even to build, a long while before
they need the nest. We have seen them hunting for
the best spot and chatting about it, as if they were
saying, "This will never do," or, "This will be just
the right place when the time comes."</p>

<p>We have seen towhees and other birds picking up
pieces of sticks and string in November, and carrying
them about as if they did not know what to do with
their treasures. We should think better of them if
they would lay the sticks and twine away in a safe
place until they are ready to use them. They seem
never to think of that, but drop the things wherever
they happen to be.</p>

<p>Birds like to pull at twine even if they have no use
for it. They pick at the ends of fibrous bark, as if
they valued most highly what costs them the most
trouble to get.</p>

<p>A lady we knew was in the habit of throwing out of
the window the hairs which came out of her head when
she used the comb and brash in the morning. These
hairs were caught in a bush, and the birds discovered
them. One day her son found a bird's nest near the
window, all lined with the white hairs which once
grew on his dear mother's head. You may be sure the
son keeps that bird's nest among his treasures.</p>

<p>Birds are very fond of hairs of any sort for their nest
linings. We have many times placed them within
their reach and sight, and they will take them up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86 ]</a></span>
They also use chicken feathers, if they are close at
hand, and bits of soft paper.</p>

<p>If you want to see something that will amuse you,
fasten on a tree or log a piece of old rope that has a
ravelled end. Every day in nesting time the birds
will tug at that ravelled end of rope, turning somersaults
in their hurry, and spending more time chasing
one another away from it than in actual work.</p>

<p>When a bird begins to build her nest, she uses coarse
materials first, just as a house builder uses beams and
timbers to begin with. The bird and the house builder
save all the fine stuff for the last. Look closely at a
nest when you find one. Pick up an old last year's
nest that has blown down. This year's nests do not
belong to you. See how there are, first, large sticks
or weeds, or rolls of mud. Between the large sticks or
weeds there are small, short ones. You can imagine
that these pieces all together are nails and boards, and
help to hold the whole nest together. Perhaps these
may be all bound together with spiders' web or string,
or even paper.</p>

<p>We have seen nests made of nothing but one kind of
weed; usually a weed that has a strong smell, like wild
sage or yarrow, is chosen. We think that the smell of
these strong-scented weeds prevents lice or mites from
invading the nest. Perhaps the force of habit or taste
has led the bird to select this material. Probably her
mother before her made the same sort of a nest, and
so she thinks that is about the right thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Some birds, as the swallows, make mud houses, after
the manner of the Mexicans. We often wonder if
these people got their idea of house building from the
birds.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Barn Swallow</span></div>
</div>

<p>Other birds use sticks and cement, as a man does
brick and mortar. Some of the sea birds lay their eggs
on a bare, flat rock. Even these do not roll off from
the rock, for all eggs are oblong and cannot roll in a
straight line. We have never seen a perfectly round
egg. If you take an egg of any kind, as a hen's egg,
and try to roll it down the floor or lawn, you will see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88 ]</a></span>
what we mean. Then try a perfectly round ball. You
will see that it is better that birds' eggs are oblong or
elliptical.</p>

<p>The cactus wren<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> makes her nest in the middle of a
great barbed cactus in our mountain washes or desert
places. The tiny Costa's humming-bird<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> builds its
frail nest in the prickly elbow of the low cactus that
grows in California all over the barren lowlands. This
is probably for safety. A snake could hardly reach a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89 ]</a></span>
nest which was built in the middle of a cactus whose
needles, or thorns, are sometimes an inch long.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">SOME OTHER BIRDS AT WORK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> many of the birds in our yard are quarrelsome.
They seem to respect one another's rights, especially
at nesting time. It is not so much our business to tell
bad or unpleasant things about birds, as to tell what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90 ]</a></span>
pleasant and what will make you love them. That is
why we spoke a good word for the shrikes and the
hawks and the owls.</p>

<p>If a pair of birds have selected the limb of a tree
upon which to build a cradle, they are not often driven
from it by other birds. It seems to us that when a
sparrow has put a piece of twine over a bough, it is as
if she had written her name on it or got a deed for that
particular bough.</p>

<p>If you should wish to tame a pair of birds that are
building their nest where you may watch them, wait
until the nest is finished or until the first egg is laid.
Sometimes it is better to wait for the little birds. A
bird will desert an unfinished nest if she suspects you
are watching her. But she dislikes to throw away all
of her labor, and will often lay her eggs and hatch her
young while you are looking at her, rather than begin
her nest all over again.</p>

<p>If you take just one egg from the nest of some birds,
leaving all of the others, the parents will never go to
it again. There are other timid, delicate birds who
will leave their nest if you just go up softly and peep
into it. The parent birds may not be in sight, and
you may think they will never know. But they have
been in hiding and have seen you steal up, and they
will desert the place and the nest. Only a few birds
will do this, however, and these are mostly those which
live far away, in a quiet dell or on a hill where people
seldom go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91 ]</a></span></p>

<p>We feel quite sure that we can tame almost any home
bird at nesting time. A goldfinch<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> has just built her
nest in an apple tree near our house. We have tamed
the mother bird so that we can smooth her feathers on
her neck and breast with our fingers while she is sitting
on the nest. At first we took leaves in our hand
and touched her with them. She did not care for the
leaves; they were all about her in the tree. Gradually
we dropped the leaves, until she was not afraid of our
hands.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> <i>Spinus psaltria.</i></p></div>

<p>We wished to take a photograph of her, and did so
one very warm day. She sat in the heat, with her
wings lifted to let the air through, and her bill parted
as if she were panting. The father bird comes to feed
her on the nest, just as their young are fed, with his bill
in hers. These finches are nurslings, you know, and
are fed on prepared food.</p>

<p>The oriole<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is a very interesting bird with us. She
chooses to hang her hammock or cradle beneath a festoon
of thick leaves on a swaying bough, or from a drooping
twig. Here she prefers a broad green banana leaf or
the great leaf of a fan palm. These leaves are good
shelter from the sunshine.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> <i>Icterus cucullatus nelsoni.</i></p></div>

<p>The banana leaf is about five feet long, and doubles
on its midrib like a book cover during the middle of
the day. At night and early in the morning, when it
is cool, the leaf opens better, and it is then that the bird
works at her hammock. When the pouch is finished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92 ]</a></span>
the leaf is kept from doubling quite up and is like a
sharp roof over the heads of the young and their mother.
The banana leaf is constantly waving and trembling,
even when there is scarcely a bit of breeze.</p>

<p>Another favorite place for an oriole to build her
hammock is the under side of the fan-palm leaf. You
will wonder how a bird can weave a thread in and out
of a leaf, when she has no fingers or needles. We have
watched an oriole do this many a time, and this is how
it is done. She takes a thread in her beak and pushes
it through the leaf from one side. Then she flies to
the other side and pushes the same thread back through
another opening in the leaf which she has made with
her bill. Thus she weaves a kind of cloth pouch on
the under side of the leaf, flying back and forth from
the upper to the under side. The pouch or hammock
is lined, and there the eggs are laid. You can see the
mother's head sticking out from the nest, but if she
knows you are watching, she will draw her head out of
sight, so you will see nothing but the nest.</p>

<p>The thread most used by orioles here is the fibre
which ravels from the edges of the palm leaves. Where
such thread is not to be had, they use twine or string
of any sort.</p>

<p>Young orioles meet with many dangers before they
leave the hammock. Sometimes their feet get tangled
in the thread or horsehairs of which the nest is partly
made. When the little helpless things attempt to fly
out, they are sometimes caught by the toes, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93 ]</a></span>
they bang. We have rescued several which were
caught this way.</p>

<p>It seems strange that a bird which can build so beautiful
and fine a nest of threads does not know enough
to pull the strings off from her baby's toes when it is
caught in this way. They may do this sometimes, but
we have never seen them do anything but fly about in
a helpless way, chattering as orioles do.</p>

<p>Orioles keep no secrets to themselves. They are
"tell-tales," and keep up a constant chat among themselves
and at intruders. They are different in this
respect from some other birds, who are as quiet as mice,
never whispering a word as to where their nests are,
and deceiving you, if they can, by limping away as if
they were hurt. Such quiet birds will raise a nest
full of birds and be off while you are wondering where
they are.</p>

<p>We do not have chimney swifts in California; but
we lived in New England once, and we recollect very
well what a racket they used to make in the chimneys.
Sometimes the nests fell down into the fireplace, and
then what a commotion!</p>

<p>Some swallows choose to build under the eaves, and
in caves and tunnels, and on the under side of bridges,
or in crevices of rocks. We have often wondered that
a bird mother can tell her own nest among so many
that look just alike. We have stood and watched the
barn swallows, and felt sure that they count, "One,
two, three, here's my nest." How else do you suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94 ]</a></span>
that a mother can be sure that she has come to the
right nest?</p>

<p>We have seen mother birds cry and call loudly, as if
for help, when the babies have fallen out of the nest.
If you pick up one birdling and place it back in the
nest, the mother takes a quick glance at it, and then
goes on calling as before. She will not stop until she
sees every one of them safe back in the cradle. This
makes us think that some birds do count.</p>

</div>

<p>In Tennessee, where we once lived, the cat-birds and
brown thrushes used to build their nests in the porches
and vines above the door. Sometimes we would take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[ 95 ]</a></span>
the young birds from the nest and keep them in the
parlor for company, taming and feeding them, and
allowing them to flutter about on the floor to amuse
strangers. Perhaps we would have them in the house
for an hour.</p>

<div id="fig_27" class="fig_center" style="width: 440px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Brown Thrush.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When we opened the door to take them home again,
the old birds would be standing close by, like dogs
whose masters are in the house. When they saw us,
they would set up such a scolding that we felt quite
ashamed for having kidnapped their children even for
so short a time. They grew used to our ways before
the summer was over, and would soon let us take the
young without so much ado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Small birds, such as the goldfinches and humming-birds,
use a good deal of spider's web in making their
cradles. This is very soft, and when many strands are
used together it is very strong. This web is used to
hold the mosses and plants down in place. When you
see the bushes and hedges all covered with web in a
damp morning, think of the little bird house-builders.
Watch, in some quiet corner out of sight of them, and
you will see the mother humming-bird or goldfinch
dart up to the glistening webs and examine them in
turn, just as a lady who is out shopping examines the
different goods in a store.</p>

<p>Madam Bird flies down to a small web, taking a bite
at it with her slender bill, as if she were feeling of it
with her fingers.</p>

<p>Then she flies off to another spider's counter of goods
and pecks at another web. When she has found what
suits her, she will take several bird yards of it home
with her.</p>

<p>In the nest of our goldfinch in the apple tree, we see
some spider web binding the grasses together, but the
nest itself is lined with horsehairs. We have one bay
horse and one black horse. In this nest lining there
are hairs from the tails of both horses, woven round
with great care in a striped way, that looks as if the
bird had thought about how it would look, the red and
the black together.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">A PET HUMMING-BIRD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Humming-bird</span> mothers are very tender of their
young and will seldom go out of sight of them. We
have ourselves picked the mother from the nest and let
her go, when she would immediately return to it.</p>

<p>If you see a humming-bird sitting on a twig napping,
just clasp your hands behind you and go straight up to
the bird. You can almost touch it with your face, but
if you put out your hand the bird will dart away. A
hummer will alight on the flowers you may be carrying,
if you remain perfectly still. These birds seem
to notice movement more than form.</p>

<p>Humming-birds, like many others, do not seem to
notice a person if he is going toward them in a straight
line. It is "sidewise" movement that frightens them.</p>

<p>We have known a humming-bird to "play 'possum,"
though we are told, by some one who ought to know,
that it was really frightened almost to death.</p>

<p>This bird had come in at an open window for some
flowers left on the sill. On leaving the room, by some
mistake it flew up to the ceiling instead of going out
at the window. The ceiling was high, so we took a
long broom and chased the bird, catching it on the
wisp end and bringing it down. It did not stir,
though we were sure we had not hurt it. We took it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98 ]</a></span>
in our hands, and it lay on its back with its eyes shut,
as if it were indeed dead. Then we carried it to the
garden, feeling very sorry. Suddenly one black eye
opened, and then the other, when, in a flash, the little
bird was off.</p>

<p>One day in spring a certain professor whom we know,
who is very fond of hunting toadstools, caught sight of
what he felt sure was a rare one on the limb of a live-oak
tree. The heart of the professor beat with joy, for
he would rather find a new kind of toadstool or lichen
than a gold mine, and he put out his hand to pick this
new one off. It moved, and he looked at it. It was a
baby hummer, just fledged, and very delicate. It did
not know enough to be afraid of him, and cuddled in
his hand as if it were the nest.</p>

<p>He knew how much we like birds, and so the professor
put the baby in his pocket basket and brought it
home to us. The bird was unhurt and as free from
fear as a real baby. Its face looked like a baby face,
as the faces of all young birds look, innocent and sweet,
and full of a helpless, not frightened, expression. You
can look at the pictures and see that this is true.</p>

<p>To feed this bird, which seemed hungry, we mixed
some sugar and water. It would not open its bill, so
we held the sweet in a spoon and dipped the beak into
it. It tasted, and then put out its tongue and lapped
some. This very slender, thread-like tongue was long
and black and very quick of movement.</p>

<p>Every hour we fed it with this sweetened water, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99 ]</a></span>
it came to know the spoon by sight and to look for it
when we were coming. We moistened our lips with
the syrup, and the little thing would move towards us,
placing its bill on our lips and thrusting its dainty
tongue all around in a way that was very amusing.</p>

<p>We did not know as much about humming-birds then
as we have learned since, or we should have fed it as
often as every fifteen minutes, and used honey in place
of water.</p>

<p>[Transcriber Note&mdash;Do NOT feed Humming-birds honey. Honey does not have
the same chemical composition as floral nectar and is more difficult for
Humming-birds to digest.]</p>

<p>It loved to perch on the edge of a wicker basket,
whose rim was so easy to cling to. It would shimmer
in the sunshine like a piece of silk, no larger than "a
great big bumble-bee."</p>

<p>In a few days it could fly all about the room, but it
could not fix its toes on or around anything, and would
fall helpless to the floor or drop behind the pictures.</p>

<p>It was cold at night, though we covered it with warm
things, and often we would warm it in our hands before
morning. It needed the warmth of its mother's breast.</p>

<p>It learned to drink cold water, and to expect it after
each meal of syrup, as if it wanted to rinse its mouth.
It lapped up the water like a kitten, its queer, frail
tongue looking like a bit of black thread in the clear
water.</p>

<p>We tried to get it to take tiny spiders, which we
hunted in the garden, but it refused, and did not live
with us very long.</p>

<p>We think we ought to have given it a little milk to
take the place of spiders, which it must have missed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100 ]</a></span>
We shall never try to have another pet so frail as
this; these birds seem too delicate to touch. Our fingers
are not light enough. We have a friend who kept
a young hummer for three months, and they are said to
live even longer than this when in captivity.</p>

<p>Of all our bird friends, we think the humming-bird
the most wonderful and interesting. This perhaps is
because it is the smallest and wisest of all the birds
we know.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">HOW WE TOOK THE HUMMING-BIRDS' PICTURES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are seventeen or eighteen kinds of humming-birds
in the United States. Here in Southern California
we have five of six. The largest of these is
the Anna's Humming-bird.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was called "Anna's
Hummer" in honor of a lady of that name.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> <i>Calypte annae.</i></p></div>

<p>This bird measures about four inches from the tip of
its beak to the end of its tail. The female is a mixture
of gray and green underneath, with a shining
green back. The male has a throat and head of changeable
bright colors, which shimmer like some metallic
substance as he turns about in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The bill of these birds is five-eighths of an inch long,
and the tongue is much longer. With this long, extensible
tongue it can suck the honey from the deepest
flowers. It may be seen about the petunias and the
honeysuckle and the nasturtiums. There is plenty of
sweet at the end of these trumpet-like flowers which
the bees cannot reach with their shorter tongues.</p>

<p class="tdr2"><i>Page 100.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[ 101 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the Anna's Hummer which we photographed
last year on purpose to put the pictures in this book,
that those who do not have humming-birds nesting in
their yards, or where they can study them, may see
just how they look.</p>

<p>We have no snow storms here, but in their place are
long, cold rain storms, with many days of bright, warm
weather between. Flowers bloom all the time, and the
humming-birds see no reason why they should not
attend to their housekeeping. It is as if they thought,
"Now this storm is over, we will build our cradles,"
never once thinking of the possibility of there coming
another storm before the birdlings are out of the nest.</p>

<p>We were walking about in the yard one bright morning
late in December, when a humming-bird poised
herself above some pampas grass and stole a single
tuft. This pampas grass sends up its long spikes of
plumes in midsummer, and we always leave a few of
them on purpose for the birds to get for their nests.
They are very dusty and weather-beaten by winter, but
that makes no difference, for the little separate tufts
are good for crib beds.</p>

<p>When we saw the bird at the pampas grass, we knew
that she was nesting, so we watched her. She flew to
a low shrub near the path and left the tuft. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102 ]</a></span>
darted to a cypress hedge where there were plenty of
spiders' webs. She gathered a bill full of this web
and returned to the shrub. In a moment she was off
to the pampas grass again, and we stole up to look.
Not three feet from the ground was the beginning of
the smallest nest. As yet it was a mere filmy platform
set where two twigs joined hands, beneath a cluster of
bluish-green leaves.</p>

<p>The bird was shy and would not return while we
were in sight, so we went away and waited, knowing
that we must be very careful not to disturb her if we
wished her to finish her nest.</p>

<p>Taming this little bird was the work of many days.
At first we sat perfectly still on the door-steps, not ten
feet away. She saw us even there, and would wait in
the trees above for a long while before she was quite
sure we would not harm her. In a day or two we
could sit on the steps or move about, but not too near.
Before the nest was as large as a walnut the bird
allowed us to watch her a few feet away, provided we
stood motionless. She was indeed a delicate creature,
winding the web around and around, so that the pampas
tufts should be thick and firm.</p>

<p>On New Year's day the first tiny oblong white egg
was laid. It was a gem, the size of a navy bean, in a
nest-setting of silver-gray softness. We clasped our
hands in delight at this beginning of what would be
living rainbow tints. In four days its mate was laid
by its side. These birds always lay just two eggs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103 ]</a></span>
Every day the mother bird was adding more web and
lichens and pampas tufts, turning about gently and
rapidly to shape the nest around her.</p>

<p>We have never seen any birds except the hummers
who add to their nests during incubation and after the
young are hatched. On the twentieth day of January
the first egg was hatched. We stole up to look, and
there at the bottom of the small cradle was what
looked like a tiny black grub, perfectly bare. We imagined
the mother was very happy and thinking in
her dear little heart how much the baby resembled its
father.</p>

<p>The father, as is the custom of the males of these
humming-birds, was away in the foothills sucking
sweets from the mountain flowers, and leaving to his
mate all the care of the household. It seems very selfish
of him, but the mother bird may be very glad to be
without him. What does a father humming-bird know
about taking care of such tiny babies?</p>

<p>One day later than its mate the other egg was
hatched, and there were a pair of black, bare grubs.
They had no bills, except a tiny point in the middle
of the mouth, which they kept open in a coaxing way.
They could move nothing but their heads, and their
eyes were shut tight. How carefully the mother fed
them. Many a time, looking on at meal-time, we were
tempted to caution the mother lest she thrust her bill a
little too far down the small throats. She winked her
black eye at us, while we stood with uplifted finger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104 ]</a></span>
as much as to say, "Don't be afraid, I have nursed
babies before."</p>

<p>As the birdlings grew, the nest had to be enlarged,
and it took every minute of the mother's time to keep
the household matters in order. In a few days down
began to appear upon the birds, and then a shimmering
green on the backs, like that of the mother's dress.
Young male hummers do not get the bright head and
throat until the first moult. When the birds were thus
clothed, the mother did not seem to think it necessary
to build the nest up about them any higher, so the
birds were crowded out gradually as they grew, until
they were obliged to sit on the edge, a pair of the
sweetest twins one ever saw.</p>

<p>A storm came down from the mountains and surprised
the faithful little mother, but she sheltered the
babies as best she could until we came to the rescue
with a gingham apron, which we pinned in place above
the nest, making a complete shelter for all. We kept
this apron in place for a week, or until the storm was
over. People passing by must have thought us very
queer housekeepers to spread our washing in the front
yard, but we did not stop to explain.</p>

<p>By this time the bird had grown so trustful that we
could do almost anything without scaring her. We
fed the young with syrup on the ends of our fingers,
while the mother looked on astonished. They would
put out their fine thread-like tongues and look at us
from their tiny black eyes, as if thanking us. Their
bills had grown out until they were quite respectable
by the time the babies sat on the edge of the nest.</p>

<p>As soon as the mother became tame enough, we took
the pictures, as you see them. While we stood at the
nest, she would fly all about our faces and look at our
ears and eyes, and buzz at our hair in a very funny way.
Once we bent the twig from its place in the shrub,
and held it close to our faces, and the mother fed the
young, brushing our cheeks with her gauzy wings.
Then we tied it back to its old place when the mother
had flown away. She came back and flew in our faces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106 ]</a></span>
as if she expected to find the babies there. Not finding
them with us, she went back to the shrub as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful thing to have this shy bird so
trustful and willing to have her photograph taken.</p>

<p>The older of the two birds left the nest first, and we
had hard work to get him to be still enough for the last
sitting. The mother came down and sat between the
two birds on the twig, and looked at the bird who
wouldn't keep still, as if she were scolding him.</p>

<p>She seemed just like a real person taking her baby
to the artist's to have his picture taken. Once two
strange old hummers came when we were taking the
pictures, and bothered us a good deal. They made our
mother hummer nervous and cross, and she drove them
away. It seemed to us that these birds wanted to have
their picture taken too, but we could not quite catch
them, because they were not well enough acquainted
with us and the camera.</p>

<p>One day the babies left the old battered nest and flew
to the trees. The rim of the nest was torn and worn
away by the feet of the mother as she stood to feed the
young. We noticed that for a few days after they
were hatched she fed them every fifteen minutes, but
as they grew stronger she gave them their food only
once an hour, or at even longer intervals.</p>

<p>After they had flown, there came a hard storm, and
we went out in the morning expecting to find the babies
dead on the ground. But not so; there they sat in the
sunshine above our heads, as safe as could be. They
remained about in the yard for two or three weeks,
when they disappeared, no doubt going to the foothills
to join their father at sucking sweets and flitting
among the vines.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">OUR ROBIN REDBREAST.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> every child knows the robin redbreast. He
is a great favorite wherever he goes. We have him
with us in Southern California only in winter time for
a few weeks after the rains have come. When our
ground is mellow with moisture, and the angle-worms
have worked their way to the top, leaving little loose
hillocks all about the yard, then we look out for a visit
from the robins.</p>

<p>They come in companies great enough to fill the
tree-tops, and their constant song reminds us of old
times when we lived in the New England States.</p>

<p>Robins are "water birds" in a way, although they
do not swim. They are perfectly at home in wet grass
or foliage, and even in a rain storm. They never seem
to have any use for umbrellas.</p>

<p>Once, while on a visit to some friends in the east,
we found two baby robins which were blown from their
nest in a storm. We fed them with bread soaked in
milk, and fresh beef, and they thrived. We shut them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108 ]</a></span>
in an empty room upstairs, and they soon learned to
look for us and to know our step. They would fly to
the crack of the doorway and squeal when they heard
us coming. Before we dared open the door, we had to
push the birds away, for fear they would be caught and
hurt.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Robin.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When we were ready to start for our California home,
we put the robins in a cage, taking as much food as we
thought they would need on the journey. In a day or
two the meat gave out, and they grew tired of bread
and water. They coaxed constantly for beef, so we
asked a porter on our car to get some for them.</p>

<p>By this time most of the passengers had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109 ]</a></span>
interested in our robins, and a gentleman offered to
keep them in beef for the rest of the journey. He
would go out once a day, when the train stopped long
enough, and buy some beef. Our pets came to be
quite an attraction in the car, and everybody was
anxious to do something for the little travellers.</p>

<p>We took the birds to the dressing-room each day to
clean the cage and to give them a bath. We washed
them one at a time, in our hands, holding them under
the gently flowing faucet. At first they objected, but
they soon grew to like it.</p>

<p>During the first year they never sang a note, for
their unmusical squeak could certainly not be called
singing. The second spring we gave them a large
cage in the yard, that they might make the acquaintance
of other birds. In a short time an old mocking-bird
came and gave them music lessons.</p>

<p>The teacher would twist his toes around the wires of
the cage, in this way holding himself close to the birds.
Then he would twitter softly, until the young birds
had learned to respond and to twitter too.</p>

<p>When at last the robins did have a song, it was a
mixture of robin and mocking-bird notes. They did
not speak pure robin all that year.</p>

<p>After they were grown-up birds, the mocker who had
taught them music took a great dislike to them. This
was very strange, for he had been so fond of his little
pupils, dropping berries down through the cage wires,
and calling them all sorts of pet names in his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110 ]</a></span>
language. Now he would scold them and peck at them
and scare them, until we were obliged to cover a part
of the cage.</p>

<p>In a year or two the male robin got out of the cage
and flew away. We could hear him far out of sight in
the trees, but he would not come back, though we
called to him in our kindest tones. He was out all
night, and we supposed he was dead, as he was at the
mercy of the mocking-birds.</p>

<p>What was our surprise early in the morning to find
him on the hitching-post near the house, with his bill
wide open, screaming for his breakfast. But he would
not let us put our hands on him.</p>

<p>Then we thought of a plan to catch him, the same
by which wild animals are sometimes caught. We
scattered some crumbs from the post where he sat to
the door of the cage, and Robin went to picking them
up, of course, being very hungry and not thinking
about the consequences. He followed the trail of the
crumbs until, before he knew it, he was safe within
the cage and the door was shut.</p>

<p>Once again he got away from us, but we knew he
would come back at meal-time, if the shrikes and the
mockers did not find him. Birds which have lived for
a while in a cage seem to be perfectly helpless when
out at liberty, not knowing how to find food for themselves,
and dying of hunger in the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>Sure enough, at supper time Robin came back, clamoring
for his share. There was a soft, moist place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111 ]</a></span>
the garden where we were in the habit of digging
worms for the robins at night. We took the cage and
set it down by this place, with the door tied back.</p>

<p>We went to work with the spade, pretending not to
notice the little runaway, who hopped close to us and
screamed at his little innocent mate in the cage. We
threw some worms in at the open door for the bird on
the inside, who ate them, taking no notice of her companion
on the outside.</p>

<p>Suddenly the outsider hopped to the hole where we
were digging and tried to grab the worms before we
had time to pick them up. But we cheated him, understanding
his little game, and dodged past him with the
coveted worms. He, standing on tiptoe, danced about
in the funniest fashion, still trying to snatch the
worms. All at once, taunting him with a good long-worm,
we threw it past him into the cage. Away the
bird ran after it, and the little fellow who loved so
well to "play hookie" was caught once more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">MORE ABOUT OUR ROBIN.</p>


<p>When the robins were two years old, we noticed
that they were picking up straws from the bottom of
the cage, and so we "took the hint." We looked all
about to find something that was the shape of a nest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112 ]</a></span>
We were tempted at first to put a little open-work
basket in the cage, but we remembered an experience
which we had some years before, and did not use the
basket.</p>

<p>The experience was this. We hung a tiny basket
in the canary's cage, and the birds made a thin nest in
it and hatched their eggs. The male had been very
active, helping his mate in all the ways he could think
of, and he thought he would mend the nest one day.
So he began to peck at the string through the meshes
of the basket, reaching up from the bottom. We did
not think he was doing any harm, till we noticed what
looked like a bird's foot hanging down through the
bottom of the basket. What was our astonishment to
find that the old bird had pulled off the legs of the
young birds, stupidly thinking that he was tugging at
the twine.</p>

<p>Of course we did not put a basket in the robins' cage,
but we found a round butter mould, which answered
just as well. The birds were very much pleased with
the butter mould, and began carrying straw and mud
which we gave to them, until they had quite a respectable
robin's nest. We do not know whether wild
robins would nest in a butter mould, if we should
fasten it in the crotch of an apple tree or swing it from
the branches, but it would be quite worth one's while
to try, if one is living where there are wild robins.</p>

<p>One morning we found a blue egg in the nest. The
birds were surprised. They hopped on the rim of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[ 113 ]</a></span>
butter mould and looked at the egg and chirped at it,
and then the male bird hopped in and sat down on it.
We clapped our hands and called to the whole family
to "come and see."</p>

<p>But what do you think that naughty bird did? Just
as we were all feeling sure of his good sense, he jumped
suddenly out of the nest and then back again. Then
he began to scratch with both feet as fast as he could,
till the egg went out of the nest and lay in fragments
on the bottom of the cage. We expected to see his
mate resent it, but she took no notice, going on pecking
at a peach as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"It was an accident," we said, ready to excuse our
pets. The days went by, and seven blue eggs shared
the fate of the first one. The birds took turns at
scratching them out of the nest, as if it were great
fun. We felt badly, of course, and scolded them.
But they only stared helplessly at us, and did not
explain the secret about those eggs.</p>

<p>When the robins were three years old, the male began
to be sick. He had "fits" or spasms of some sort,
whirling around on the floor upon his back, where he
would lie as if dead for a few minutes. Then he would
jump up and begin eating, as well as ever.</p>

<p>These attacks grew less severe, and in a few days
the bird got well. His mate had taken excellent care
of him, begging him to eat something right in the
middle of his fit, and flying about him just like a nervous
little woman. When she had nursed him back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114 ]</a></span>
life and health, she was taken with the same disease
and died in a short time. We asked a doctor what he
thought it was, and he said he "guessed it was the
grip."</p>

<p>The little widower did not pine away and die from
grief; he was too sensible for that, and life was very
pleasant to him. He took to singing with all his
might as he had never sung before. For four hours in
the early morning he never rested his bulging little
red throat, not even to eat his breakfast. The old-fashioned
robin notes, which he had made believe he
never knew before, came bubbling out in a wild glee
that made the neighborhood ring. People inquired all
around to know where that robin was.</p>

<p>He was very fond of spiders, and when we took the
broom in our hands he watched us closely. The large
gray house spider was his favorite.</p>

<p>We think a good deal of these spiders, and were very
sorry to give them to the robin, but we were afraid he
would die if he had none. In whichever room we were
when we found one of these spiders, we had only to
call out, "Here's a spider, Robby," and the bird would
chirp his answer, hopping to the corner of the cage
nearest the door. Here he would wait for us to give
him the insect. If we found a bug or a worm, we had
but to call out, "Quick, Robby," and he would dart
nervously from side to side of his big cage in his eagerness
not to keep us waiting. He would take berries
from our mouths, many a time giving our lips a tweak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115 ]</a></span>
as if he did it on purpose. Then he would stare at us
with his black eye full of fun.</p>

<p>A Chinaman with a vegetable cart came to our house
three times a week, and Robby grew to know him and
his wagon. He knew the sound of the wagon before
it was in sight. He was always afraid of strangers,
but this Chinaman he loved and trusted. He would hop
to his cage door to meet him, and open his bill for the
strawberry which "John" never forgot in berry season.</p>

<p>He was fond of meat of any kind, taking it salted
and cooked or raw. But he would never touch bird
flesh of any sort,&mdash;chicken or quail or turkey,&mdash;though
we many a time ran to the cage calling, "Quick,
Robby" just to surprise him. He would look disgusted
and turn his head away, as if to say, "No,
thank you: I am not a cannibal." He would not
taste of sugar, but was fond of gingerbread and cake.</p>

<p>During our long dry season of many months, Robby
had a way of his own to keep cool and moist. His
bath was an oblong china vegetable dish, which held
water enough to cover him at full length.</p>

<p>When the days were warm and dry, and Robin somehow
missed the rain which he had never seen in summer
time, he would hop into the bath and sit or lie down.
The water covered him up to his ears; and there he
would sit for an hour at a time, blinking and dozing,
as if he were a real water bird. He would take food
from our hands, too lazy and contented to stir out of
the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116 ]</a></span></p>

<p>When the tourist robins came in winter, we imagined
our pet would remember his mate and be anxious
to join the birds. But he took no notice, caring not
so much for the robins as for the brown towhees who
had always kept him company at the back door.</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought his house was small, and if all
"his folk" were intending to spend the winter with
him he would be crowded "out of house and home."
He was not hospitable to them, nor had he "rooms to
rent." He not even answered them when the tourists
chirped him a last good-bye and went away in early
April, after they had eaten up all the pepper berries.</p>

<p>Well, the longest story has an end. When our robin
was in his fifth year he died, and we buried him beside
our little humming-bird under the fig tree. The bees
in the orange blossoms all about him sang him a dirge,
and a royal mocking-bird carolled away with all his
might.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">GOING TO BED AND GETTING UP.</p>


<p>As we told you before, birds do not live in houses or
sleep in bedrooms; though in some parts of the country
they build their cradles in little bird-houses and boxes
or anything of the sort which you will give them. But
here we have never succeeded in making any of them
occupy a place which we have prepared for them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117 ]</a></span>
though we have made the prettiest little houses, and
nailed boxes in cosey places. The western race of the
house wren nests with us; so also does the bluebird.
But these birds have not become civilized and prefer to
stay in the mountains and far-off places.</p>

<div id="fig_30" class="fig_center" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/fig_30.png" width="484" height="401" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Western Bluebird.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Birds never call to one another to "Be sure to leave
the window up for fresh air," and they do not try to
get more than their share of the blankets, as some
children do. Each bird carries his bedding about on
his back, like a tramp, and he takes the first warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[ 118 ]</a></span>,
sheltered nook he can find for his bed. Some birds
appear to go to the same place to sleep every night.
We suppose they feel more at home in one spot, if they
have not been molested there. When we find a particular
spot where we know the birds are in the habit
of sleeping or roosting, we are careful not to disturb
the bush or tree.</p>

<p>Some birds sleep with their heads all covered up
with the bed-clothes, as if they were afraid, like foolish
children. Perhaps they like a warm night-cap,
though we do not see how they need one with such a
thick head of hair as they have. We call it "tucking
their heads under their wings."</p>

<p>It is a queer fashion to stand or squat on one foot
all night, instead of lying down like other people.
We suppose they use one foot at a time, so that the
other may be rested. You have noticed that anybody
who must stand for a long while usually favors one
limb or foot, holding it up a little at the knee joint,
and after a time changing to the other. Try it yourself
and see.</p>

<p>One very odd position in which some birds sleep is
upright on the bark of a tree trunk, clinging to the
wood with their toes, and propping themselves up with
their strong, pointed tail-tips, as the flickers and some
of their friends do.</p>

<p>Going-to-bed-time and getting-up-time are happy
hours with the birds. About sundown you will hear
them saying, "Just one more twitter," "One more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119 ]</a></span>
worm, if you please," or, "One more flight to the
highest tree."</p>

<p>While you are watching them in the soft twilight,
there is a sudden hush and not a bird is in sight. If
you have not been paying close attention, with your
eyes wide open, it will be impossible for you to tell
what has become of the birds, they go to bed so quickly
and silently. Not a sound will break the stillness,
unless a merry mocking-bird wakes you out of your
sleep.</p>

<p>These mocking-birds sing to us all night long at
some parts of the year. You know these birds came
by their name because they deserve it. They mock or
mimic every bird they hear, including the hens and
turkeys. We have wondered why they do not talk as
well, but we have never known them to.</p>

<p>One mocker in our yard gives us the postman's
whistle every afternoon an hour before it is due.
Strangers rush to their gates, thinking their mail has
come, while the mocker laughs at them from the tip-top
branch of a eucalyptus tree, seventy or eighty feet
above them.</p>

<p>If you have just come to California, you are likely
to be waked up in the middle of the night by the sound
of your pet chickens peeping, or the turkeys crying as
if in distress, and you imagine all the fowls in the
coops are being carried off.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will snatch a broom or an apron and run
out quickly, sure of finding the marauder. From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120 ]</a></span>
top of his tree, safe out of your reach, that little rascal
of a mocker will "peep" again, and then you will understand
that it is only one of his jokes. Often they sing
beautiful songs by the hour, and we lie awake to hear,
laughing at the racket, or holding our breath to catch
the last note of some wonderful melody.</p>

<p>Besides the mocking-bird you may hear the owl,
though you cannot be quite sure that it is not the
mocker again. In the dusk, when it is just light
enough to see a little, you may catch a glimpse of the
"Poor Will," darting about for his supper among the
belated gnats and flies.</p>

<p>When this bird came to California he left off saying
"Whip Poor Will,"<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and so has but two notes. "Poor
Will" is not whipped in this beautiful land.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> <i>Phaenoptilus nuttalli californicus.</i></p></div>

<p>One will have to get up very early to see the fun
among the birds in the morning. A chirp in the twilight,
the breakfast bell ringing from the throat of the
first bird up, and then how astir are the trees and the
bushes, and the whole yard or field! It is impossible
for you to tell where the little songsters came from so
suddenly, just as it was impossible for you to tell
where they went to sleep the night before.</p>

<p>If there is a tub of water by the pump, the rim of it
will soon be covered by the birds; or, better still, if
there is a leaky hydrant, or a spring in the berry patch,
or a puddle in the orchard, there you will see what is
sure to make you laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The swishing and the diving and the twittering and
the dressing of the birds, and the flying particles of
water like a shower bath, are enough to make you glad
that there are birds alive.</p>

<div id="fig_31" class="fig_center" style="width: 458px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Whip-poor-will</span></div>
</div>

<p>Let lazy people lie in bed on a bright morning.
They will never know what fun they miss, even though
they may read about it. It is better to see a fine thing
for yourself than to depend upon what other people
have to say about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122 ]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time ordinary people are up, the birds will
have settled down to the business of the day. Their
dresses and coats are brushed, and their hats and bonnets
are on "straight."</p>

<p>The drip, drip, of the hydrant, or the babble of the
brook do not tell what they saw an hour ago. The
old sun, looking down steadily in your face, never
hints at sights that made him smile so out of the
corner of his eye when he first got up at call of the
birds.</p>

<p>It is a very odd thing that the birds have to wake
the sun every morning in California. Look about you
early and see how it is where you live.</p>

<p>"Get up, old Sun! get up, old Sun!" they all scream
at once, and they keep right on making as much noise
as they can, until the lazy old fellow is fairly out of
bed. Tell your friends, if they do not believe this,
that they and old Sol himself had better take to getting
up earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>That is a queer old proverb, "Early birds get the
worms." You have all heard it, and it tells the truth.</p>

<p>Did you ever see the ground all covered with tiny
little mounds of fresh earth in the morning when it is
damp? Angle-worms do not like the sunshine; they
will die if exposed to it. So they come up to the surface
of the ground in the night, while we and the sun
are asleep, just to get a bit of fresh air and to look
around the world. If they do not hurry back to their
home in the ground, they will get surprised by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[ 123 ]</a></span>
"early birds," who help themselves to all the worms
they want.</p>

<p>That is a good proverb for the birds and the worms,
but it has another meaning for us all. "Early birds
get the worms" means "If you want to see pretty
things, and hear fine music, and have a good time, you
must get up early in the morning." So if you would
see all the bird-fun in your yard, you must be up and
out as soon as there is the least bit of light, or you will
be too late.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">MRS. TOWHEE PROPOSES A GARDEN PARTY.</p>


<p>"Let's give a garden party," said Mrs. Towhee to
Mrs. Ph&#339;be; "it is lovely weather, and we haven't
had a garden party for ever so long."</p>

<p>"Good! let's do it," answered Mrs. Ph&#339;be. "You
go and give out the invitations, while I get things
ready."</p>

<p>"There is a new family up in the eucalyptus house,"
said Mrs. Towhee, calling her friend back. "They are
little mites of people, almost as small as the Hummers.
I wonder if it would be proper to invite them to our
party. They are strangers here, and no one I have
seen ever heard of them before. You know we ought
to be careful about the new people we meet."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," the other said, smoothing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124 ]</a></span>
slate-colored breast. "Ask Mrs. Mocker; she knows
everybody."</p>

<p>So they called to Mrs. Mocker. "Do you know that
new family up in the great high house? They must
be fine people to move into such a handsome place.
The Oriole family have rented that house for years."</p>

<div id="fig_32" class="fig_center" style="width: 454px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be.</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I know them," Mrs. Mocker said; "they are
Mr. and Mrs. Bush-tit from over in the mountains.
They never lived in our city before. They belong to
the great Tit family, and their name means a Tit-in-a-bush."
Then Mrs. Mocker looked very knowing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[ 125 ]</a></span>
put on airs, as she always does. She knows that she
is acquainted with everybody, and she is proud of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Towhee and Mrs. Ph&#339;be nudged each other.
Then they asked Mrs. Mocker if she would "introduce
the new neighbors at the party."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mocker agreed to do this, and then Mrs. Towhee
went away to invite all the people, and Mrs. Ph&#339;be
got the garden ready. She swung on all the bough-swings
she could think of, to see if they were safe;
and she hunted up all the nice nooks and corners to
play hide-and-seek in; and she tested the food which
was sent in to see if it was all right. Then she went
upstairs into the top stories of the tree-houses and
waved her hand to all her bird friends.</p>

<p>It was a busy day among the bird people. They
washed themselves, and combed their frizzes, and cocked
their hats, and trimmed their bonnets, and flirted their
coat-tails, and fixed their best trails, and took especial
pains to have their feet clean. They made their
nails look neat, too; strange a bird should think
of that. But birds are ladies and gentlemen, you
know.</p>

<p>"Is my gorget all right?" asked Mr. Hummer of
Mr. Sparrow.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by your gorget," said
Mr. Sparrow.</p>

<p>"Why, it's this shining patch I always wear under
my throat. Really it is a diamond scarf-pin which has
always been in our family. It is an heirloom. Rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126 ]</a></span>
large, isn't it? but all the gentlemen in our family
wear them, and that is what makes the fashion, you
know." Then the vain young hummer turned his head
all about in the sunshine to make his gorget shimmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Mr. Sparrow. "How do you like
my new garden hat? You see it is striped,&mdash;two black
stripes and three white stripes. It is very costly, and
I hope it will wear a whole year."</p>

<p>"Why, that is a beautiful hat," answered Mr. Hummer.
"Do you suppose those new people up in the
big house will come to our garden party?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so," said Mr. Sparrow. "And there
are some more new people here, tourists, just passing
over the Southern-Pacific-free-to-all bird route. They
have stop-over tickets, I understand, and I mean to
ask Mrs. Mocker to invite them all. She likes to get
acquainted with strangers for the chance of mocking
them behind their backs. I can't help liking her,
though."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Mr. Sparrow, "it isn't right to
gossip about one's neighbors." Then in a low tone
he added, "If you don't know anything good to say
about a person like Mrs. Mocker, it shows you do not
know her very well."</p>

<p>Mr. Mocker heard what they were saying about his
wife, and he fell to mimicking them in a low key till
the gossipers all flew off.</p>

<p>Just then a red-shafted flicker called to his next
neighbor, the humming-bird, with a loud, harsh cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127 ]</a></span>,
which so frightened the little hummer that he dropped
straight down from the bough he was sitting on, right
into the lap of a rose that happened to be spreading
her skirts below.</p>

<div id="fig_33" class="fig_center" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/fig_33.png" width="453" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Flicker.</span></div>
</div>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of me," said the flicker,
"that is my natural voice. I was going to tell you how
I scared an old lady in the white house yonder. I
flew up to the gable under the eaves and began hammering
away with all my might on the house-side. You
know my hard, stout bill is my hammer. It went 'rap,
rap,' just like a man with a hatchet.</p>

<p>"Out came the old lady, and she looked all around
the house, thinking to see a burglar, I suppose, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128 ]</a></span>
then she went back and locked the door. Soon I began
to hammer again. She came out, and this time she
looked straight at me and said, 'Shoo, you old bird!'
Of course I flew away. All I wanted was to make a
hole in the roof over the attic, so I could have a warm
place to sleep in this winter."</p>

<p>"I don't think it was kind of you to scare an old
lady," said the hummer, sitting still in the lap of the
pink rose. "That is the same lady who left her
pampas plumes standing in the yard when other people
had cut theirs down, on purpose that my wife might
have the feathers and tufts to line her nest with.
They are splendid to make a cradle of, they and the
spider's web. It was that same old lady's daughter
who put the umbrella over our nest in the rain storm.</p>

<p>"That young lady thinks she can catch me. I go
and sit on a low bush and doze in the sunshine, showing
off my gorget as well as I can, when along comes
the young lady. I blink away, and she thinks I am
fast asleep. As long as her hands are behind her I
know I am safe, and I let her get close to me. But
the minute she puts out her hand to catch me, I am
off, and you ought to see how disappointed she looks."</p>

<p>"That is a very long story for such a small bird as
you are," said Mr. Flicker to the hummer. "I could
tell one twice as long."</p>

<p>Mr. Flicker was beginning his yarn all about how
he scared some small boys just at sundown in a grove.
He said he flew up quickly, and his flame-colored wing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129 ]</a></span>
linings looked so much like fire that the boys ran
away.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Mocker set up such a noise, squalling
like a chicken when it is caught, that the birds all flew
away to their houses, all but the hummer. He wasn't
afraid of a chicken, and he sat still in the lap of the
sweet rose.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">AT THE GARDEN PARTY.</p>


<p>The morning dew was not off from the lilacs and
the sweet calamus in the garden when the birds began
to come to the party.</p>

<p>They came in pairs, and in groups, and in whole
families. They were turning their heads this way and
that, whispering and chatting and showing off their
new spring suits, and looking shyly at the different
kinds of food, like people at a picnic.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said old Mrs. Goldfinch to Mrs.
Hummer. "I see you have a son almost as large as
yourself. I do not understand how that can be so early
in the season."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am very proud of my son," remarked Mrs.
Hummer. "I have a daughter almost as large as my
son. They are both very much like their father. I
had good luck in raising them. It stormed once right
into the nest, when they were very small and weak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130 ]</a></span>
but I kept mending the cradle as well as I could with
thread which I bought of Mrs. Spider. I brought both
of my children to the party with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never take my children to a party," said Mrs.
Goldfinch. "I leave them with their nurse."</p>

<p>Mrs. Goldfinch said this with a haughty air, which
quite amused Mrs. Hummer. She knew very well that
Mrs. Goldfinch kept no nurse, but took care of her
children herself night and day. "Very likely the cats
will get them to-day," Mrs. Hummer was thinking.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Mrs. Warbler to Mrs. Cliff
Swallow. "I did not know you had returned. Have
you come to stay with us now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I have come to stay," answered Mrs. Cliff
Swallow. "We have taken rooms under the barn
eaves. We are just making a cradle for the young
ones we hope to have by and by. We have had a
hard time to get all the mud we wanted, and thought
we should be obliged to give up nest-making for this
year. There was a nice puddle in the road where we
were at work; you know we like road mud best, because
it is so fine and sticky. When school let out, the small
boys threw stones at us, hoping to hit some of us, I suppose,
and so we had to go down to the river to get our
mud, and that wasn't half so good as the road mud."</p>

<p>"That is too bad," said Mrs. Warbler.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cliff Swallow went on to say, "We have just
heard such a slander about our family. Mrs. Owl told
us. She overheard it outside of a window in the evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[ 131 ]</a></span>
Somebody has started the story that we swallows
have fleas and other vermin in our nests, and on
that account we ought not to be allowed to build around
houses and barns. It is a dreadful story, and so false.
I wonder how it started. I felt almost too ashamed to
come to the party."</p>

<p>"Too bad; too bad," said Mrs. Warbler again. "I
would not pay any attention to it. Folks will say
unkind things about us all, if they happen to find just
one of us in mischief. Of course all birds do have a
few little mites or fleas in their houses, and they can't
help that, any more than those great human people can
help having house-flies and mosquitoes about them
where they live.</p>

<p>"Now some folks think I pick holes in the window
screens, just because I love to run over them, up and
down and all around, after the flies. To be sure, I do
stick my toes through the meshes to hold myself on,
but what of that? I love to peep through the window
at people eating breakfast in the morning when the
flies are stiff with cold on the outside. I can catch my
game easily then."</p>

<p>Just then the new birds came along, and all the rest
stood in a row to be introduced by Mrs. Mocker.
"Mr. and Mrs. Bush-tit," she said, "let me present
you to all of your neighbors."</p>

<p>The strangers shook hands all around, and then the
birds fell to asking Mr. and Mrs. Bush-tit questions
in true Yankee style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132 ]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">California Bush-tit and Nest.</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Yes," they answered, "we are going to stay all this
season. We are making a cradle in the eucalyptus
house, which we have rented."</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw your cradle," said Mrs. Towhee; "it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133 ]</a></span>
such a queer one. It looks just like a bag with a little
round hole in one side no bigger than a good-sized
blackberry. What makes you build such a queer cradle
as that?"</p>

<p>"That is the kind of a cradle all our family make.
The little ones have to stay in until we boost them out,
or until they are strong enough to climb out. It is
very safe and warm. It is strong, too. We would
not think of making such a cradle as you do, Mrs.
Towhee. We felt very sorry one day when we found
one of your babies dead on the ground, where it had
fallen out of the nest when it was too weak to fly."</p>

<p>"Well, we are glad to see you, anyway," said Mrs.
Towhee, wiping the tears out of her eyes. "Now make
yourselves at home, and let your little Tits come over
and play with our little Towhees."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bush-tit bowed politely, and then
along came Mr. Bluebird. "Why, how do you do?"
he said. "What brought you here? I thought you
lived up in the mountain with the other Bush-tits."</p>

<p>"What brought you here?" they answered, laughing
in the sweetest way. And then they agreed that our
yard is a very nice place, and they thought they would
"bring their friends" often and picnic.</p>

<p>"We never have rented a house in this street," said
Mr. Bluebird, "but we may do so some day. Do you
think it would be safe to try to raise a family so near
those great people?"</p>

<p>"We think so," said Mrs. Bush-tit, "but you ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134 ]</a></span>
to see them stand and stare at us. A big, kind-faced
boy comes every day and writes in a note-book, looking
straight into our house. Once he climbed up on a
ladder and examined it. We were very much afraid,
but he did us no harm. His eye was so blue and clear
we could see ourselves in it. It looked just as if he
couldn't hurt a bird.</p>

<p>"Then one day a lady came with the boy, and they
both watched us and tried to make pictures of us, but
we wouldn't keep still long enough. The lady is that
boy's mother, and we heard her say, 'We'll tame these
bush-tits some day, Jo, just as we did the humming-birds,
and then we will write all about them for
children to read.'"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Bluebird said, "Isn't it strange what queer
things people do write about us? Sometimes they are
right, and sometimes they are wrong. I wish some
bird author would write a book about men and women
and their queer ways. Wouldn't it be interesting?"</p>

<p>Then Madam Bush-tit laughed a merry little giggle
that made Mr. Mocker look up in surprise, and he ran
it over in an undertone before he should forget it.</p>

<p>Just then a yellow-breasted meadow lark carolled
his sweet ditty on the tip-top of a pine tree. All the
birds flew to welcome him to the garden party, coaxing
him to stay and offering him lemonade from the cup of
an orange blossom. They all loved Mr. Meadow Lark.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," he said; "I must be off. I love
the fields better than the door-yards, and the violets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135 ]</a></span>
and the cream-cups look out for my drink. I just came
a minute to say good morning."</p>

<div id="fig_35" class="fig_center" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/fig_35.png" width="437" height="366" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Meadow Lark.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A whole flock of wax-wings took possession of a
pepper tree and began to throw the seeds down on the
heads of the birds beneath. "Oh, excuse us," they
said, "we are tourists, and this yard looked so inviting
we stopped for a few moments. How much do you ask
a dozen for these pepper berries? We do not have any
in our country. They are good eating, we find, when
one has learned how to manage them. You ought not
to charge us a great price, for they are almost all seed.
How much do you ask?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136 ]</a></span></p>

<p>All the birds laughed, and then Mr. Mocker imitated
the wax-wings, calling out in a saucy tone, "How
much do you ask? How much do you ask?" The
wax-wings were offended and flew away, the bit of red
wax on the tip of their wing feathers showing very
plainly in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"As if we ever charge anybody anything for what
they eat," said Mr. Warbler. "I'm hungry myself."
Then Mrs. Towhee, who had really gotten up the
garden party, called them to dinner.</p>

<p>All the birds helped themselves. The hummers
dipped away down into the honey-pot of a morning-glory,
and the towhees and mockers ate worms and
crickets in the damp grass; the warblers snatched gnats
on the wing, and the bush-tits ran up and down on the
tree boughs, in search of bugs so small nobody else
could see them. Each bird took the sort of food it
liked best, drinking at the hydrant and breaking the
bottles of the raspberry vines.</p>

<p>Suddenly along came Mr. Butcher-bird. "Go away,
go away," all the birds cried. "Nobody invited you
to our garden party."</p>

<p>"But I am here," said Mr. Butcher, in an impudent
manner. "I should like to have a taste of that fat
young hummer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hummer screamed, and down swooped the
butcher. Everybody thought he was going to make a
meal of the baby, when he surprised them by grabbing
up a great Jerusalem cricket and darting off with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[ 137 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Butcher-bird thought it was a good joke, and he
laughed loudly from the peach tree. But the birds
were so scared that they all flew away, and so the
garden party broke up.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">OUR BIRD HOSPITAL.</p>


<p>Cities have their hospitals for the sick and wounded.
When an accident happens to a person in the street, or
a man falls from a building, or is burned, or is hurt in
any way, he is taken to the hospital, where the surgeon
does what he can for him. Sometimes his life is saved
by the surgeon's care and the kindness of trained
nurses.</p>

<p>If a stranger in any city is taken sick, and has no
friends to care for him, he is carried to the hospital,
where he is nursed back to strength. If he has no
money, he is quite welcome to all this.</p>

<p>A long while ago, when we first began to be interested
in birds and to think of them as "people," like
ourselves, we found it necessary to have a bird hospital.</p>

<p>Our native birds seldom meet with accidents unless
they are killed outright; but the tourist birds are often
found injured in some mysterious way, so that they
cannot fly. We feel sorry for these strangers so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138 ]</a></span>
from home, and so we pick them up and carry them to
our hospital.</p>

<p>We have several empty cages about, one being the big
cage which used to be "Robby's" house. When Robin
died, we thought it was a pity to give his cage away
or to have it doing no good to anybody.</p>

<p>So we called it our hospital. This hospital is "In
memory of Robin," as hospitals are sometimes built in
"memory" of great men, or with money which rich
men have left for that purpose.</p>

<p>We do not remember how many birds have been
taken to our hospital, but there have been a great
many. We use the "smaller wards"&mdash;the little
cages, you know&mdash;for little solitary birds.</p>

<p>The last patients which we had in the large hospital
were two wax-wings which we found maimed in some
way so that they could not fly. They could get along
pretty well low on the ground, but we were afraid the
cats would steal them, and so our hospital nurse took
charge of them.</p>

<p>At first they were very wild and would scream when
we touched them. But they tamed readily, and in a
day or two would sit on our fingers and eat from our
hands. We knew they were berry and insect eaters;
but, as it was winter, and the insects scarce, we could
think of nothing they would like but the pepper berries.
They lived on these for a few days, but evidently
wanted other food.</p>

<p>We tried angle-worms, but these did not suit. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139 ]</a></span>
morning at breakfast little Sister, the hospital nurse,
was holding one of the wax-wings on her finger, when
it began to snatch at the bread crumbs. It was as if
the little bird had been used to home-made bread all
its life.</p>

<div id="fig_36" class="fig_center" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/fig_36.png" width="293" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Wax-Wing.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We kept these two beautiful patients in our hospital
until they were quite strong, and just before the last
of the tourists went away they joined their friends and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140 ]</a></span>
flew off as if nothing had happened. We thought we
saw them in the trees once again, but were not certain,
all wax-wings look so very much alike.</p>

<p>At first, when we let them out of the cage, they
would run back and go in at the open door; but soon
they heard their mates calling and joined them. We
had their photographs taken just before they went
away, as people have the pictures of their friends to
"remember them by."</p>

<p>The birds who are at liberty are very attentive to
the birds in the hospitals, and hop close to them, as if
they were inquiring all about their troubles.</p>

<p>Besides these sick birds in the hospital, we have the
"out patients," young birds which we feed and look
after when they happen to fall out of the nests. They
cry all about at nesting time, so that it is as much as
one person can do to keep the cats away and see that
nothing happens to them.</p>

<p>Boys in our neighborhood know how we love the
birds, and often bring them to us if they are hurt, so
that they may have the benefit of our hospital. This
is better than to leave them where they happen to fall,
for the cats and dogs to worry. There are many ways
in which we can show our affection for these little
people.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3nb">A SPLENDID COLLECTION.</p>


<p>We could never finish a book if we told all there is
to know about birds. So we shall have to close our
story about these people, hoping that children who read
it will love the birds better than they ever did before.</p>

<p>The birds will stay with you wherever you live, even
if it is on a lonely island or a western prairie. There
will be garden parties, and morning concerts, and evening
serenades, and visiting birds will drop into your
yards and stop awhile. Birds are just like other
people; they like to take a meal with a neighbor now
and then. It makes good feeling on both sides.</p>

<p>Any one can have a fine collection of beautiful birds
without going to the museums. Not dead, stuffed,
songless creatures, who cannot say "Thank you" for a
crumb, or warble you a melody in return for a home in
your yard. You can have this splendid collection flying
from tree to tree, and making cradles among the
flowers, and giving a garden party every day in the
year, even though the snow lies on the ground.</p>

<p>There are wise people who study birds all their lives,
never killing the little things to put away in a drawer
with camphor balls. Such people come to love the
birds very much, and to know their sweet, wise doings
in a way that a person with a gun can never know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142 ]</a></span>
them. Sick people can sit in the sunshine or in the
shade and study the birds, and grow stronger as well
as wiser.</p>

<p>There are some strange collections of birds to be
found in milliners' shops. The milliners are not to
blame for these, for if good and kind people did not
want any out of their collection, they would not keep
so many.</p>

<p>Sometime on your way home from school, if your
mother is not wanting to see you early, look in at these
show windows and see the collections we are speaking
of. These birds are sold to foolish women and girls,
and worn to church and everywhere else on hats and
bonnets.</p>

<p>See how distressed the poor dead creatures seem to
be,&mdash;how they are twisted all out of shape. They are
made to squat or perch in positions that make them
look as if they were in agony. Not one of them all
has a natural, happy look, because the people who put
them up to sell have never loved the birds nor studied
their ways. All they care about is the money they can
get for them.</p>

<p>You will notice that some of the birds in ladies' bonnets
have been cut in two. Sometimes just the head
and wings are to be seen. If these ladies stopped to
see what they were doing, and to think of how ridiculous
they look, they would never wear these ornaments,
just like savages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143 ]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the birds that are very rare and beautiful
have been nearly or quite all killed for this fashion.
Some of the most delicate plumes you see have been
taken from the egret, or white heron, at nesting time.
The mothers are shot or stoned to death very easily,
because they will not leave their young. It is said
that many are left wounded and yet alive after the
plumes have been stripped off. There is no one to
care for the young which are left in their nests, and
so they die of cold and hunger. All this suffering
is just to satisfy the cruel pride of women and girls
who must wear birds in their bonnets.</p>

<p>If boys would resolve never to kill a bird, even
though they could get money by doing it; and if girls
would resolve never to wear a bird or a bird's wing on
their hats, our country would be more beautiful with
song and color than it has ever been.</p>

<p>We sat in church the other day, and in front of us
was a lady with nine bird's wings on her bonnet. She
was a tender-hearted lady, and probably would not hurt
a fly herself. Yet her pride had really caused the death
and suffering of five birds, and possibly of fifteen or
twenty birdlings. She did not stop to think. Will
you, kind reader, stop to think?</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
